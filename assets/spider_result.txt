(From left to right) Prof. Dik Lun Lee; Mr. Wing Sing Wong; Miss Manli Zhu; Mr. Haibo Mr. Haibo Hu, Miss Manli Zhu, PhD candidates of the Department of Computer Science, and Mr. Wing Sing Wong, a MPhil candidate, have formed the team "Pegasus" and joined the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2004. The team has won the 4th Runner-up out of 20 teams from all over Hong Kong. A trophy and HK$40,000 were presented to the winning team on May 19, 2004 at the Imagine Cup Award Ceremony on Microsoft DevDays 2004 which was held at the Grand Ballroom of Conrad Hong Kong Hotel, at the witness of more than 600 audiences. "Microsoft Imagine Cup 2004 gives us an invaluable chance to turn our research idea into reality. We have devoted our effort to location-based service and mobile computing research and are desperate to see if any of our research ideas and results can be transformed into practical prototypes applicable to daily life. The experience in Imagine Cup 2004 is definitely a positive answer. We would like to thank Microsoftt Hong Kong for organizing such a challenging competition for the students and researchers in Hong Kong. In addition, we owe our thank to our department for her full support, and Prof Dik Lun Lee, our supervisor, for his valuable advice and guidance throughout the competition" the Pegasus team said. This is the first time for Microsoft Hong Kong to launch the Imagine Cup in Hong Kong. The winning project "i-Surround: A Location-Aware Messenger Service" is supervised by Prof. Dik Lun Lee. "I am particularly happy that the students took the initiation to join this competition. Within 2-3 weeks of time, they pulled together what they learnt and materialized their ideas in a functional prototype. It is not just hard work; it is the team work and the confidence that amazed me. I think the Department must have done something right in providing the students with a stimulating research environment," Prof Lee recounts a meeting where the students presented their ideas to him. i-Surround i-Surround is a location-aware information publishing and subscribing platform. Using location-aware techniques and intelligent information filtering and ranking systems, it aims at transferring information to anyone who needs it in a more efficient and effective way, while preserving user's privacy and eliminating spam messages. The platform can support various client devices such as PDAs, mobile/smart phones, notebooks and tablet PCs. "Messages would be everywhere. Through i-Surround, we believe information can virtually reach any user who needs it without having the user to ask for it" the Pegasus team said. The inspiration behind Imagine Cup is to challenge the world's most creative and tech-savvy university students to design the best new Web services solutions. All around the world, .NET programmers are proving that you can go from idea to prototype in less time than ever before. Both undergraduate and postgraduate students are eligible for the event. The Imagine Cup 2004 contains four categories, Software Design Invitational: local competition, Rendering Invitational: Online worldwide direct registration, Algorithm Invitational: Online worldwide direct registration, Short Films Invitational: Online worldwide direct registration. The Software Design Invitational is to highlight and reward excellence in the field of student programming. This year the focus is on teams of up to four students working with mobile devices, smart systems, and .NET to create software solutions that improve everyday life. This is the only category that has a local competition.

TITLE: Understanding Users' Preference on Big Data | HKUST CSE

There exist many different ways of helping a user to solve this problem. One is an interactive approach which asks the user a number of questions (e.g., presenting two records and asking the user to choose a more preferable record) and then learns the user's preference automatically. Another is a log-oriented approach which analyzes the user's log data recorded by the system and learns the user's preferences via some data mining and deep learning approaches. After a user's preference is found, his/her favorite record can be easily determined. The following figure shows a scenario of our interactive approach. Consider that a user would like to find his/her favorite car. After asking the user about 5-7 questions, our system is able to know the user's preference and find his/her favorite car. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods in the literature of machine learning and database require asking the user about four times as many questions as in our system, which is tedious for the user. The figure below shows the user interface of our demo system that helps a user find his/her favorite car. Consider the log-oriented approach. Whenever a user visits a website, all activities of the user can be tracked. We proposed to use a recurrent neural network-based approach to model a user's preference in order to find the record that s/he is interested in. Our experimental result shows that the accuracy of our proposed approach is better than the best-known result. Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong has led a research team working on this project. Details about this project can be found in the following publications: Tianwen Chen and Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, "Session-based Recommendation with Local Invariance", the 19th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2019), Beijing, China on November 8-11, 2019 Min Xie, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, and Ashwin Lall, "Strongly Truthful Interactive Regret Minimization", the 2019 ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), Amsterdam, The Netherlands on 30 June-5 July, 2019 Min Xie, Tianwen Chen and Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, "FindYourFavorite: An Interactive System for Finding the User's Favorite Tuple in the Database", the 2019 ACM Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), Amsterdam, The Netherlands on 30 June-5 July, 2019 (Demonstration Paper) More Research Projects Navigation Navigation About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements Last updated on 2019-08-19 Privacy Sitemap Copyright © The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

MATE coordinated an international student underwater robotics ROV competition. A network of 20 regional ROV contests took place across U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, Scotland, and Japan. Student teams from upper elementary, middle schools, high schools, home schools, community colleges, universities, and community organizations participated. In addition to technical skills, the event helped students develop the ability to solve problems, think critically, and work as a part of a team. By connecting students with employers and professionals from the workplace, students were also exposed to ocean-related career opportunities. The HKUST ROV team designed an underwater robot which incorporated aesthetics, simplicity, and functionality into its design. The design led the team stand out in the competition.

CHAN Tony F. CHAN 陳繁昌 PhD in Computer Science, Stanford University Professor Emeritus Links: Personal Webpage Scholar Profile Personal Webpage https://tonyfchan.ust.hk/ Research Interests Computational mathematics; Image processing; Computer vision; Physical circuit design; Computational brain mapping Biography Prof. Tony Chan was the third President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He was previously Assistant Director of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) in charge of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, which is the largest directorate of the NSF. In this position, he guides and manages research funding of almost HK$10 billion a year in astronomy, physics, chemistry, mathematical science, material science, and multidisciplinary activities. Prof. Chan had been in the NSF position since October 2006 upon taking temporary leave from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was Dean of Physical Sciences from July 2001 overseeing over 200 faculty members, 700 graduate students, 700 under-graduate majors, and about HK$550 million in annual federal research support. Prof. Chan's scientific background is in Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering. He received his BS and MS degrees in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University. He pursued postdoctoral research at Caltech as Research Fellow, and taught Computer Science at Yale University before joining UCLA as Professor of Mathematics in 1986. He was appointed Chair of the Department of Mathematics in 1997. He also holds honorary joint appointments with the University's BioEngineering Department and the Computer Science Department. Prof. Chan was one of the principal investigators who made the successful proposal to the NSF to form the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA, with a vision to promote collaborations between the mathematical sciences with the general scientific and engineering disciplines. He served as IPAM's Director from 2000 to 2001. Prof. Chan is an active member of many scientific societies, including Fellow of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) where he had served on both the Board of Trustees and the Council, as well as Member of the American Mathematical Society, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). He has served on the editorial boards of many journals in mathematics and computing, including SIAM Review, SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing, and the Asian Journal of Mathematics, and is one of the three Editors-in-Chief of Numerische Mathematik. He co-wrote the proposal to start a new SIAM Journal of Imaging Sciences and serves on its inaugural editorial board. He formerly served on the NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee and the US National Committee on Mathematics, and represented the US to the 2006 General Assembly of the International Mathematics Union in Spain. He had served as founding co-Director of the Center for Computational Biology at UCLA, an interdisciplinary center funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the NIH Roadmap initiative, until he had to relinquish that role to take the position at NSF. His current research interests include mathematical image processing and computer vision, Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) physical design and computational brain mapping. He has published over 200 refereed papers and is one of the most cited mathematicians. He has mentored over 25 PhD students and 15 postdoctoral fellows. He has given many invited plenary talks at national and international meetings, including the 1989 SIAM National Meeting, the 2002 Joint Mathematics Meeting, and the 2005 Asian Mathematics Conference. He has won two Best Paper Awards (IEEE and International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis) and has served on many national and international advisory committees. In October 2007, he became one of the five academics in the field of Mathematics to be elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has maintained frequent and close relationships with Mainland China and Hong Kong over the past two decades, and has served at various local institutes since 1985 as visiting professor and external examiner, including the University of Hong Kong, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Baptist University, and City University. He was named CUHK United College Distinguished Lecturer in 2002, along with Nobel Laureate Prof. Yuan-Tseh Lee. He has made over 30 academic visits to Mainland China and in October 2007 he led a National Science Foundation delegation to visit key government authorities related to science and technology. Born and brought up in Hong Kong, Prof. Chan attended the Salesian English School and Queen's College in Hong Kong before furthering his studies in the US.

These are the criteria that count for data analysts and business users who need to perform analytical queries on a large amount of data with complex conditions and return aggregated results that can enable decisions to be made. For example, a sales director of a company handling millions of transactions per day might be interested to know the total revenue of all transactions for a specific product category in a certain period of time, where the buyer and seller are in specific regions, and the product has parts manufactured in yet another region. Yet, long running times for such analytical queries, even in leading, commercial-level database systems, are still among the major challenges to overcome. Prof Ke Yi, an expert in database systems and algorithms, has solved a problem that has taxed the community for over 15 years, enabling responses to queries to be given in seconds rather than minutes or hours. Prof Yi and his team's novel algorithm allows the database to return approximate results in a very short time, and continue to improve their accuracy as more time is spent. Working on datasets of 100 gigabytes and larger, their "Wander Join" algorithm achieves more effective sampling through random walks, returning results with the same accuracy (for example, 95% confidence and 1%error) in one-hundredth of the time compared with prior solutions on the same hardware. The algorithm has been integrated into PostgreSQL, Spark, as well as Oracle through PL/SQL, demonstrating its viability in a variety of settings and bringing the sought-after goal of interactive data analysis a step closer. This work was carried out in collaboration with the University of Utah, and has received the 2016 ACM SIGMOD Best Paper Award.

Pick an interesting topic that is related to courses you've already taken. Start your project early and work hard at the beginning to research related work, especially algorithms, techniques and tools. Think hard to identify the key factors that will determine success and then focus hard on these. Possible key factors might be: accuracy, speed, cool graphics, user-friendliness, business value, a unique feature or an innovative technique Plan and think. For software development projects, pick powerful development tools and utilize a bug tracking system. For group projects, use a centralized revision control system, including a wiki and an SVN, to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Think outside the box, i.e., look at problems from a new perspective and be courageous to experiment with new techniques, especially if they might possibly yield better results or save time. Meet regularly with your supervisor (at least once a month) to receive good guidance. Read all the papers suggested by your supervisor. Strive hard to produce a complete system that meets all the requirements, persevering through difficulties. Trust your group mates and work as a team.

The team was supervised by Prof Jogesh Muppala. The competition aims to encourage local university students & researchers to use intelligent technologies to improve everyday life. The names of locations in Hong Kong are difficult for tourists to pronounce and remember. Tourists often have trouble communicating with local citizens. The project is an android phone application. Users can select the text language: English, Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese. When users tap on a location on the Google maps of Hong Kong, the system displays the address name in the three languages. They can choose to hear the pronunciation in the language chosen. The system utilizes a built in Android text-to-speech (TTS) engine for English, an open source TTS engine for Putonghua, and a custom-made TTS engine for Cantonese. The system also links to a website called Expat/ Tourist Sharing Board, which is also created by the team for users to find additional information. The history of places tapped by the user is also available.

We therefore contact numerous companies in different industries every year to arrange summer internship and one-year internship of computer-related discipline for our students. General Guidelines If you are interested in offering summer internship and/or one-year internship to nourish the next IT generation, or to train up potentials for your company's future development, please contact us today! The following information may serve as general guidelines to help you with the planning. 1. Duration Summer Internship: 3 months, from June to August of the year. One-year Internship: 12 to 15 months, from June of the year to May or August of the next year. 2. Training & Supervision It is suggested that the company should provide a relevant training program for each student intern. It is expected that students should be provided opportunities to learn different skills, both technical and non-technical through the trainings and their job duty itself. Besides, it is highly recommended for the company to assign a mentor with relevant expertise to supervise the student intern. The mentor should be responsible for providing general guidance and technical advices to the student, assessing their performance during the training period and reviewing their training from time to time. 3. Making a Job Offer If the company makes an offer to a student, details of the terms (e.g. name of student employed, position, salary, employment period) should be given to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering via mmsend('csinternship') for reference and record. If the company requires student to sign a separate company employment contract or any other agreement, a copy of the document should be sent to the Department for reference as well. 4. Termination If, for whatever reasons, the company would like to terminate the internship with the student, the company is advised to discuss with the Department for the best possible solution for the both parties, before any action is taken. The Department of Computer Science and Engineering shall have the right to terminate the internship in case a lack of appropriate training or support to the student during the internship is found. How to Get Started (for both internship and graduate jobs) Company interested in offering summer internship, one-year internship or graduate jobs to our students should first complete the job posting form and email it to mmsend('csinternship'), and we would respond to you at our earliest convenience to discuss the possible arrangement.

This would greatly help them to develop their personal interests and prepare for further postgraduate studies. Outstanding Student Achievements Our students often say that a big part of their education takes place outside the classroom. They have performed very well in various awards and competitions, like the Golden Penguin Greater China Open Source Software Competition, IBM PhD Fellowship Program, ACM KDD CUP Data Mining Contest, and ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. Our department has our own programming team for ACM competitions. Here is the list of student achievements. Various Scholarships The University, as well as the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, offer students a number of scholarships, each typically ranging from HK$10,000 to HK$40,000 per year. Exceptionally outstanding students may receive up to full tuition fee plus HK$40,000 per year. Each entrant is automatically considered for such scholarships. Most scholarships are awarded to students based on their academic merit and the department's recommendations. Valuable Industrial Exposure Students have the opportunity to gain industrial exposure and learn the skills necessary to begin successful careers by participating in internships. Students have a wide range of internship choices to suit their preference. Some of the companies where our students have taken up placements and internships recently are HSBC, Lenovo, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, PricewaterhouseCoopers, etc. Overseas/Mainland Exchange Programs These exchange programs let students study for one year or one semester at an overseas or Mainland top university with no additional tuition fees. Currently the School of Engineering has more than 100 international exchange partners, including University of California at Berkeley, University of California at Los Angeles, University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, University of Washington, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and University of Sydney. One of the Five High-Impact Areas in HKUST's Strategic Plan 2016-2020 In view of the distinguished achievements of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, information technology and data science in deemed an important and integral part of the HKUST Strategic Plan 2016-2020; it is one of the five high-impact areas where HKUST aspires to lead, rather than follow, scientific and technological trends.

FYP/FYT Short Video Starting from the 2019-20 academic year, the CSE Department requires each FYP group and each FYT student to produce a short video to introduce and summarize their project or thesis. It should be a 3-minute video in mp4 format. Basically, the video is like a movie trailer. It should explain what your FYP or FYT is about, highlight the important elements and possibly provide motivation for viewers to learn more. It can also be used at the beginning of your oral presentaton to introduce your concept or thesis Requirements Follow the CSE Department FYP/FYT Short Video instructions for making and uploading your video Suggestions Start early - maybe in January or February - to plan out your script and begin to capture video footage or capture screen views of your project in action. Be creative and tell a story. Tell about cool things you did in your FYP/FYT. This may include creative ideas, special applicaiton of your software engineering skills, your challenges or your joys during the FYP/FYT. It may record your hard coding work during midnight. It may show the proud demo of your final results, and much more. Be creative. Brainstorm. Watch some previous FYP/FYT videos that were selected as the best ones. Use a good microphone and a quiet place to record the audio. If possible, be taking photos and/or video clips of your project development so people can visualize what you did. According to your type of project, capture videos with a camera or screen capturing software. Still shots can be good too; pick the best ones. Edit the video clips with tools like Camtasia, Adobe Premiere Pro, OfficeMix, iMovie, MS Movie Maker and Goanimate.com (for DIY animations). Make your video before the oral presentation, so you can use it during the presentation (if you advisor thinks that it's a good idea). Other information After the deadline, the CSE FYP judging committee will vote for the best videos. For further inquires, please contact the FYP/FYT coordinator.

TITLE: Spatial-Temporal Crowdsourcing Group: Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing
https://www.cse.ust.hk/stc/projects/gmission.html
DATE: Mon, 15 Apr 2019 09:17:35 GMT, 8306
Home Research Publications Code Task Assignment in Spatial Crowdsourcing Spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a location-based request to workers according to their positions. We focus on batch-based task assignment studies, which means we assign a set of workers to a set of tasks every a period of time. To conduct real world experiments, we designed and developed a general spatial crowdsourcing platform gMission, which are opensourced and avaiable on both Apple Store and Android Store. With spatial crowdsourcing, we can conduct a sort of interesting things. One example is 3D reconstruction with photos contributed by workers. Below is an completed example video.

Karmanye Vaadhika-raste, Maa Phaleshu Kadachana; Maa karma-phala-hetur-bhoorma, MaTe sangostwakarmini. You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive. Nor let your attachment be to inaction. अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम् | विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम् || 14|| Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVIII, Verse 14. adhiṣhṭhānaṁ tathā kartā karaṇaṁ cha pṛithag-vidham vividhāśh cha pṛithak cheṣhṭā daivaṁ chaivātra pañchamam. The body, the doer, the various senses, the many kinds of efforts, and Divine Providence —these are the five factors of action.. संस्कृत: सुभाशिता: अन्नदानं परं दानं विध्याधनमतः परम् | अन्नेन क्षणिका तृप्तिः यावज्जीवं च विध्यया || Sanskrit Subhashita Anna daanam param daanam vidyaa danaam atah param . annena kshinikaa truptih yaavajjeevam cha vidyayo. Serving food to the needy is a charity of high order and so also teaching some one free of charge.

Session 4 (5:50-6:30pm) Discussion about security industry Moderator: Dr. Ricci IEONG, Adjunct Assistant Professor, CSE Department Title 1 (5:50-6:10pm): UST alumni in Security Industry Abstract HKUST is the nest of security experts. Many of our HKUST alumni are working in the security industry. So Ricci arranged a forum discussion with a number of UST alumni who participated in Hong Kong Security Industry to discuss on the following topics: How they started to participate in the industry? What are the hot topics in the security industry? What is/are missing from current Hong Kong security market? What university in Hong Kong can help Hong Kong security industry? Title 2 (6:10-6:30pm): How to switch from fresh grad to security specialist Abstract As the nest of security experts for over 20 years, many of HKUST alumni not only participated but also drive the security industry in Hong Kong. However, as industry practitioner, Ricci found that university fresh graduate may not be able to fit well into the Security Industry. So Ricci invited a number of HKUST alumni who graduated from different year to discuss together to explore how current fresh graduate can better fit into the Security industry: How our alumni started to go into Security Industry? Why they wish to work in this industry? What they think they need to prepare themselves for this security work? What is the "one thing" they consider students should do before they can find a security work?

The event was well received by alumni families, young graduates, students, faculty and staff. Eighty participants, including twenty families of alumni, enjoyed a fruitful day at HKUST by joining Hour of Code sessions, badminton games, and Tea Party. The Alumni Family Homecoming Day was started by a welcome speech given by our Department Head, Prof. Qiang Yang. He briefly summarized the latest development of HKUST and CSE, such as Big Data initiatives and the latest ranking of our department worldwide. In addition, he emphasized that alumni are the essential component of the CSE community. Prof. Shing-Chi Cheung, Associate Head of CSE, expressed his gratitude to all participants. He recommended that children from the alumni families can be served as teachers to teach HKUST students programming in future. Mr. Peter Chung, Vice President of CSEAA, thanked for the generous support from CSE. On behalf of CSEAA, he looked forward to having a long-term partnership between CSE and CSEAA and a similar alumni family event can be recurrent annually. The Hour of Code sessions were tailored for the alumni families. Talented HKUST students were mobilized to serve as Hour of Code Ambassadors. They guided the children of alumni families with the aid of their parents to learn basic programming concepts using visual programming tools such as Scratch and MIT App Inventor 2. Family photos, together with the certificates of Hour of Code, were distributed to the participating families at the end of hour of code sessions. The needs of young graduates were also considered. Badminton courts were reserved for alumni to play badminton games. The tea reception provided a platform for alumni, students, faculty, and staff to mingle. Through this relaxed environment, students talked with alumni to broaden their horizons and be more prepared for their future life and career. Faculty and staff chatted with alumni families to build a closer bond with our CSE alumni community. At the end of event, a tailor-made umbrella is given as a souvenir to each alumni family. With the 25th anniversary of HKUST, the Department launches the Alumni Affairs Committee. The committee is chaired by Prof. Qiong Luo and consists of faculty and staff members with the goal to build close ties between alumni and the department. View the photo album of the Alumni Day.

It is the first time for a Hong Kong team to be awarded the Best Practical Value Award. They occupied the 1st runner-up position in the first round of the competition in Hong Kong. "Smart Eye Protector" is an Android application that aims at preventing users from several common eyes diseases such as shortsightedness, strabismus, and so on. An image processing system is combined with a camera service to measure the distance between the screen and user's eyes and record the screen-on time. By using this information obtained from the image processing system, some rules are set to prevent user from using smartphone in improper manner. User will be warned by several formats- screen-block, warning message, and pop-up preview. A usage report is provided to users so that they can understand their habit of using smartphone.

Weather data are multivariate and contain vector fields formed by wind speed and direction. Several well-established visualization techniques such as parallel coordinates and polar systems are integrated into our system. We also develop various novel methods, including circular pixel bar charts embedded into polar systems, enhanced parallel coordinates with S-shape axis, and weighted complete graphs. Our system was used to analyze the air pollution problem in Hong Kong and some interesting patterns have been found.

FYP Proposal For most FYP groups, the proposal is the first main FYP deliverable. It sets the direction of your project and becomes the foundation for your progress report. The following video introduces the sections of the FYP / FYT Proposal and gives some tips on how to start: Use your summer wisely The FYP starts in June, and the FYP proposal is due in September. Thus, the summer is the best time to do a lot of brainstorming, researching, reading, thinking and planning. A lot of groups procrastinate and wait until September to get started, but smart groups usually do a lot of their foundational work during the summer, write a draft proposal for their CT to copy edit or proof-read in September and then make changes before submitting their proposals. Proposal format Since your CT will probably want to write on a hard copy of your report, please use double line spacing for the Introduction and Methodology. You can use single spacing for other sections. For individual advisor preferences, see FYP Advisor Preferences. For more information, you can also check out the Table of Contents for the FYP Proposal. A possible plan Meet initially in June to brainstorm and assign reading. One person should be responsible to record the minutes and send a Word document ASAP to the other members by e-mail. These minutes are not only required for your FYP report, but they can also be very helpful when you finally sit down to type up your proposal. Individually read all you can about your topic and browse the Internet to look for similar research projects. Take notes and bring your findings to your second group meeting. At the second meeting compare notes, brainstorm further, and decide which information you've gathered may be useful and which information is not. Begin to keep a file of useful information, and begin compiling your references. At the end of the meeting assign more reading and research topics. Again, one member should also prepare minutes for the meeting ASAP afterwards. Individually read and research again, taking more notes for your third meeting. Read the questions you may be asked at the end of the project during your presentation to see if you are forgetting anything important. Study the FYP Report Quick Overview, which is annotated with useful comments and instructions. Download an FYP Proposal template (in MS Word format), modify it as appropriate for your project (including content, names and dates) and then save it with a new file name. At your third meeting compare notes again and decide on the best models and/or algorithms for your project. Assign one person to write your literature survey to summarize these methods and/or algorithms. (For more information, see Writing Your Literature Survey.) Assign another person to write your introduction's overview and objectives. Assign another person to compile your division of Work chart and GANTT chart. Assign another person to begin the other sections of the proposal. Future Impact Some employers and grad schools might want to look at your FYP or FYT to see what kind of work you can produce, so this project could affect your future studies or career.

WeChat and HKUST will jointly conduct Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology related research and explore the far-reaching frontiers of AI. Today AI technology is experiencing a tremendous growth, and much of this advance depends on talents, problems and data. WeChat and HKUST complement each other in these aspects, and this collaboration on AI research is expected to be long-term and world-leading. Research areas of WHAT LAB include intelligent robotic systems, natural language processing, data mining, speech recognition and understanding. The Lab will bring together top researchers in the development of innovative artificial intelligence application with the database of WeChat. Research areas News and Events One-year Anniversary of WHAT Lab in Guangzhou Nov 16 2016 Achievement sharing in WHAT Lab’s one-year anniversary Nov 16 2016 Data Visualization: God’s Perspective in WeChat Dec 30 2016 WHAT Lab Establishment in HKUST Nov 26 2015 Demos Machine Reading system Developed by Yuxiang Wu, Prof. Qiang Yang’s Group Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo Introduction: Machine Reading aims to develop Machine Learning algorithms that could read and comprehend natural language documents as humans do. With Machine Reading, natural language information is converted to the form that could be processed by computers, and could be further utilized in applications such as summarization, question answering and dialogue system. Moments Articles Real Time Propagation and Visualization System Developed by Quan Li, Dongyu Liu, Haiyan Yang, Prof. Huamin Qu’s Group Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo Introduction: In this project, we visually investigated how official public account article information propagate in WeChat platform from different perspectives, involving a 3D global overview, time-varying propagation view, community detection view, etc. We also implemented several designs by using real propagation data, including the propagation clock, propagation wave, propagation galaxy and propagating tree. The system --- WeSeer has already been deployed and applied to WeChat, Tencent for daily propagation analysis. Model-based Global Localization for Aerial Robots using Edge Alignments Developed by Kejie Qiu, Prof. Shaojie Shen’s Group Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo Introduction: "The video contains three parts; The first part presents the localization accuracy and global consistency by comparing with the ground truth provided in the indoor environment. Three trajectories of model-only, model+EKF​ and ground truth are shown in different colors. The 3D model used for localization is shown as dense point cloud. The second part shows the real-time localization results in outdoor case. Four trajectories of model-only, model+EKF, VINS and GPS are represented in different colors. The 3D model used for localization is shown as sparse point cloud for display efficiency consideration. The special outdoor case with unstable GPS is also included. Three image views including the raw fisheye image, the electronically stabilized image, and the rendered image are shown simultaneously. Besides comparing different trajectories, it is intuitive to tell the localization performance by visually comparing the similarity between the stabilized image and the rendered image. The third part of the video shows the closed-loop control by a trajectory tracking experiment using the proposed method for state feedback." Natural Language Processing Prof. Qiang Yang Machine Reading System Project Abstract: Machine Reading aims to develop computer algorithms to understand text documents and to provide document-related service. One of its applications is automatic summarization, whose goal is to produce a summary of a given article (such as news, webpages or social network posts). The summary generated would contain the key information of the article, but is much shorter. Information Extraction System Project Abstract: The function of the system could be separated into two parts: first, extracting the relation between two entities, regarded as answers, accurately; second, providing relevant evidences for the answers. Prof. Lei Chen Crowdsourcing Platform in WeChat Project Abstract: Last year, we constructed a general crowdsourcing platform based on WeChat Service Account. Data labelling tasks can be posted on this platform for WeChat users to contribute their answers. Common tasks types ( multiple choice, text input etc.) and some state-of-the-art crowdsourcing answer aggregation methods are supported. We also conducted some internal experiments with data from WeChat on it. Based on the work last year, we will conduct more experiments of labelling task with monetary rewards. Different pricing algorithms will be used to reduce the task budget. Our ultimate goal is to make this platform as competitive as current 3rd party crowdsourced labelling platforms for future data labelling tasks. Close Information Propagation and Visualization Prof. Huamin Qu Moments Articles Real Time Propagation and Visualization Project Abstract: As a new type of social networking service, WeChat has already become ubiquitous in people’s daily mobile communication. Tracking in the pulse of WeChat information propagation is important. For corporations, it enables them to get feedback of user coverage, information diffusion patterns, and gain insight into how to improve and market better. Also, the abundance of information and opinions from diverse sources in WeChat platform help them tap into the wisdom of crowds, understand the retweeting/comment/like behaviors and aid in making more informed decisions. Meanwhile, WeChat generates enormous digital data archives recording various user activities, introducing a proliferation of opportunities to understand users’ communication behaviors. Analyzing these behaviors not only helps with finding the common communication patterns adopted by the public, but more importantly facilitates the detection of anomalous users who are potential threats to society. Prof. Yangqiu Song Emoji Propagation and its impact analysis in WeChat Project Abstract: Wechat's emotional icon sets are being used more and more by their users. The recommendation and popularization of these icon sets is a great part of Wechat's revenue growth in 2017. The growth of the ecosphere of emotional icon sets will not only benefit Wechat's revenue, but will also create chances for content producers. Therefore, recognition, classification, advertising and recommendation of emotional icon sets are becoming important tasks. Compared with traditional texts and news, emotional icon sets have more unified structures; different from traditional emoji, emotional icon sets carry more vivid information through the large picture. Hence we should not merely use the previous analysis methods to analyse emotional icon sets. For example, when analyzing the propagation process, different group of people (young and old) have different tendency to use the icon sets. Also, when analyzing the propagation process, icons related to joy and anger will have different pattern of propagation, and sometimes even related to posted articles. For instance, when a article about massacre at Nanking is spreading, emotional icons about anger is spreaded at the same time. Therefore, analyzing the semantic of emotional icons is important and interesting. The project aims to introduce semantic information to the propagation of wechat icon sets, and establish unified representation with heterogeneous information networks(HIN), thus to analyse the features of propagation and find the crucial users. We hope that our research will help with Wechat's recommendation system of emotional icon sets. Close Large-scale Machine Learning Prof. Kai Chen RDMA Technology over Converged Ethernet in Large-scale Deep Learning System Project Abstract: With the rapid growth of model complexity and data volume, deep learning systems require more and more Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to perform parallel training. Currently, deep learning systems with multiple servers and multiple GPUs are usually implemented in a single cluster, which typically employs Infiniband fabric to support Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), so as to achieve high throughput and low latency for inter-server transmission. It is expected that, with ever-larger models and data, deep learning systems must scale to multiple network clusters, which necessitates highly efficient inter-cluster networking stack with RDMA support. Since Infiniband is more suited for small-scale clusters of less than thousands of servers, we believe RDMA-over-Converged-Ethernet (RoCE) is a more appropriate networking technology choice for multi-cluster deep learning. Therefore, we collaborate with Tencent WeChat in the development of their in-house deep learning system, Amber, and incorporate RoCE as the networking technology. Achieving high throughput and low latency, Amber is also able to seamlessly scale to multiple clusters using our technology stack. In the process of development and usage, we encountered and dealt with many practical issues, such as PFC deadlock, PFC storm, RDMA live lock, etc. Close Video Analysis Prof. Qiang Yang Video Understanding in WeChat Moments Project Abstract: Video captioning, describing video content with natural language, can be used for user behavior analysis, user modeling and video editing. Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performances on this task, but it is challenging to train deep neural networks when video clips lack textual descriptions, which is the case for wechat short videos. This project aims to learn a captioning model for wechat short videos by leveraging transfer learning. Close Robotics Prof. Qiang Yang Wifi Localization System Project Abstract: Abstract- WIFI Indoor localization has attracted a lot of attention nowadays due to its deployment practicability and great importance in location based services(LBS). The existing WIFI indoor localization techniques often need a very time and labour consuming data collection procedure, which makes it impractical in large scale indoor positioning applications. In this project, we propose a novel technique for large scale indoor localization using WeChat crowdsourced WIFI big data. We present two key modules in this large scale WIFI localization system. First, a crowdsourcing fingerprint map algorithm is built by combining WIFI signal and floorplan map, as well as inertial sensor data signatures, which address the location labeling problem in large scale positioning. Second, a new localization method that combines cross-domain crowdsourcing data is integrated into indoor positioning system. The goal of this project is to build an accurate, but zero-effort indoor localization system that make indoor positioning possible in large scale applications. Prof. Xiaojuan Ma Emotion Analysis based on Posture Sequence of Human Beings Project Abstract: Human pose recognition is a crucial technique for robot to understand its human partners in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Recent human pose recognition studies often rely on video clips of very specific poses pre-segmented by human annotators, e.g., jumping in sport videos. However, such manual video segmentation may not be available for real-time pose recognition in HRI, imposing challenges to pose understanding from streaming pose data for an interactive robot. In this project, first, we will propose real-time algorithms to automatically segment human poses from streaming pose data of human participants in HRI, and then classify these pose segments into meaningful high-level categories, e.g., instructional poses (e.g., pointing), informational poses (e.g., gesturing the size of something), social poses (e.g., hand shaking), and emotional poses (e.g., expression of anger etc., based on findings of existing interpersonal interaction research. Second, we will design associated strategies for the robot to parse and react appropriately to pose segments in each category. For example, for instructional poses, the robot will be programmed to recognize the commands and follow the commanders’ instructions. For informational poses, the robot will acknowledge the reception of information. For social poses, the robot will mimic the participants’ behaviours to increase the intimacy between the robot and its partners. For emotional poses, the robot will provide affective responses. Third, we will conduct a user study to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. Prof. Shaojie Shen Augmented Reality development based on monocular visual-inertial odometry Project Abstract: With fast development of mobile computing devices and sensor technology, Augmented Reality (AR) has been a hot research topic in both academic and industrial fields. The technology is tightly relevant with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in robotic areas, where the 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) agent's pose and a description of the environment is simultaneously estimated in real-time. Another related area called Structure from Motion (SfM) has similar problem formulation but it cannot satisfy the real-time requirement of AR. Actually, object tracking and environment mapping is the key in today's AR research. Constructing a dense map by using the mature visual-inertial odometry technology, which can be regarded as the state estimation part of SLAM, is one feasible scheme at the current stage. The minimum sensing consists a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit can also be satisfied with this scheme.

Hong Kong has many locations with names which are difficult for foreigners to remember. Foreigners often have troubles with communicating with local citizens, especially taxi drivers, when they go to various places. The project is an application which allows users to select the text language: English, Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese. When users tap on a location in Hong Kong on the Google map, the system displays the address name in three languages. The users can choose to hear the pronunciation in English, Cantonese or Putonghua. The system utilizes a built-in Android text-to-speech (TTS) engine for English, an open source TTS engine for Putonghua, and a custom-made TTS engine for Cantonese. It also links to a website called Expat / Tourist Sharing Board which is also created by the students. Users can view additional useful information on the website. The judging criteria of the scholarship included creativity and innovation, commercial practicability for implementation, and presentation skills.

Dealing with Free Riders Each year, some FYP groups inevitably have a free rider, i.e., someone who for whatever reason doesn't contribute much to the project. Whatever the reason, free riders can make the other teammates feel disappointed and upset. If your group seems to have a free rider, here are some possible ideas to help you deal with the situation. Diagnose the Problem Before accusing anybody of being a free rider, stop and think. Why do you feel that he/she is a free rider? Does the person attend all the meetings? How many times has the person failed to do what was expected by the group? Does the person understand what he/she is supposed to be doing? Is the person capable of doing what he/she is expected to do? Have any expectations been unrealistic? Does the person have too many personal commitments, like too much coursework or a part-time job? Does the person have any family problems or health issues? Does the group listen to the person's ideas or shoot all or most of them down? (This can be very discouraging and reduce motivation to contribute.) Based on the division of work, is the person able to work on tasks that he/she really enjoys doing or is good at? Or is he/she stuck with boring work that nobody else wants to do? Does the group affirm the person for the good work he/she has done (if any), or is the group usually critical or belittling of his/her work? Is there a super strong leader in the group who dominates decisions so much and is so hard-working that the person feels unimportant or unappreciated? Think of Possible Solutions If the group has consensus that one person is a free rider, then it's time to deal with the problem. The first step should always be to try to think of the best way to rectify the problem in a friendly, harmonious way. Asking your FYP advisor to split up your group to relieve you of your group's free rider is usually not the optimal solution. Here are some possible approaches to rectify the problem: If the person simply has a problem with time management, is there a friendly way to help him/her do better in managing his/her time, like more frequent meetings or working in pairs? Is it possible to redistribute the work so the person feels more motivated to work hard? During your group meetings, can you try to have more regular honest (and polite) evaluation of each other's progress? Is your group plagued with a competitive spirit which causes members to constantly lift up their own work, belittle others' work and avoid verbalizing any struggles, weaknesses or mistakes? If the group has a super strong leader who dominates most decisions and enjoys doing lots of work, can he/she learn to be a better and more empathetic leader so that the other teammates feel good about following his/her lead? Can he/she work more with the person to coach him/her to achieve his/her tasks? Has anyone communicated to the person that he/she is not only hurting the group but hurting himself/herself, as the project will affect future job prospects and could delay graduation in some cases? Has anyone reminded the person that at the end of the project each team member will complete a self-assessment report regarding each person's contributions and that grades will be given individually based partly on this report? Has the person's problem been brought up in a meeting with your group's FYP advisor? Have you talked to mutual friends about the problem and asked them for advice and/or help in talking to the person? Do the person's parents know about the problem? A group meeting at the person's home or a phone call to his/her parents may help. Time to Split Up? When all attempts to find a solution have failed, then you have three basic choices: Just endure the situation until the end of the project. Seek help from your FYP advisor or someone else (see above) to see if he/she can help resolve the problem harmoniously. Ask your FYP advisor to give the free rider an ultimatum to shape up or ship out. The most common choice is to endure the situation until the end of the project, part ways after the project and let somebody else deal with the person later in life, e.g., his/her parents, employer or wife/husband. But ask yourself the question: is this really best for the person in the long run? If you choose to take the matter to your advisor, keep in mind that the further along the project is, the harder it for the student to start his/her own solo project, so the advisor may be reluctant to split groups up after December. Some Things to Keep in Mind In most cases, the earlier that action is taken, the better! Avoiding the issue and just hoping it will go away often makes matters worse for the entire group, especially after December. In any case, keep in mind that you are helping both your team and the free rider. In case he/she does change and do his/her share of the work, you will have helped him/her achieve his/her goals and your group achieve its goals. It also might be good to mention that eventually someone is going to make the free rider face reality (e.g., an employer or wife/husband). A true friend will try to help him/her face reality sooner rather than later. What if you think someone is a free rider but other teammates don't think so or don't care? In that case, you can either talk to the person individually, seek your advisor's help or just endure the situation and try to be a friend, since you are a minority. Whatever you do, keep in mind that many FYP groups and professional programming teams face issues like yours, so this is a good learning experience! Just be sure to learn from it, especially when you next pick teammates for some other project. If you feel the situation you are in is unfair, also keep in mind that life is often not fair. However, there is a principle called "the Law of the Harvest" or "karma," which says we reap what we sow. If we simply focus on doing our best in our own responsibilities, then in the long run, we will benefit. Conversely, free riders will somehow suffer someday for their negligence.

Bugs in our programs such as the Heartbleed (2014) and WannaCry (2017) cost billions of dollars to fix and generate drastic social impacts. A key reason is that modern software vulnerability detection technology does not catch up with the size and the complexity of real world software system. To scale, these techniques typically relax the scanning strength, producing a lot of noise in the results, or restrict the scope, missing critical issues. Both compromises render software systems to eminent threats. Pinpoint is a new technique, designed by Prof. Charles Zhang and his research team in the Cybersecurity Laboratory, leveraging clever designs in static analysis, a methodology for predicting software behaviour through logic deduction, to discover dangerous vulnerabilities in large modern software systems. Pinpoint takes a "holistic" approach in combining the analysis of lower level memory behaviour of software systems together with the high level detection of logic errors and, thus, dramatically reducing the amount of computation. The following diagram illustrates the basic operation of Pinpoint. It is capable of detecting over 40 types of different software vulnerabilities in system as large as eight millions of lines of code within a few hours. It has discovered over 80 confirmed issues in high quality open source systems such as MySQL and Firefox. Pinpoint is also being used by world leading technical firms such as Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei. You can use Pinpoint either through the Pinpoint Online Scan or download a special PLDI desktop version, commemorating the publishing of its core technology in ACM SIGPLAN PLDI conference in 2018.

Tang Jiqing (IEEM MPhil), Leung Tsz Kin (CS Year 2), Wong Long Sing (CPEG Year1) has won the championship of the ACM(HK) Local Programming Contest 2004 which was held on June 12, 2004 at the Oen Hall Building East Wing (OEE) of the Hong Kong Baptist University. HKUST has sent 3 teams to join the competition, and Prof. C K Tang is the coach the teams. The winning team has used 733 minutes to answer the six questions, just wins by 2 minutes to the first runner-up of the competition from The University of Hong Kong. This is the second time for HKUST to gain champion of the competition, last time was 1992. They will join the Asia Regional Contest which will be held in Ehime, Beijing, Bombay, Kanpu-Kolkata, Dhaka, Shanghai, Manila, Seoul and Tehran, to pursue further championship. Twenty four teams have been invited from the eight tertiary institutes in Hong Kong and Macau: The Chinese University of Hong Kong, The City University of Hong Kong, The Lingnan University, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, The University of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Baptist University, and The University of Macau. Each department of a participating institution can nominate up to three teams to take part in the contest. Teams will then be selected by the CPC organizing committee according to the priorities indicated by the individual department, making sure that the participating teams will be evenly distributed among the departments, with no single institution sending more than three teams. Founded in 1970, the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) has been regarded as an innovative initiative to assist in the development of top students in the emerging field of computer science. The contest has been based at Baylor University since the 1980s, with IBM’s sponsorship beginning 1997. Up to now, more than 10,000 participants of the contest are coming from over 1,300 universities from 68 countries on six continents. Within the limited time, participants are being challenged for their creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs. The format of the contest pits teams of three programmers competing against the clock. The software used for development is scheduled to be based on Microsoft Windows 2000 with VC++ or Java. Each team is given six programming problems. They then try to write programs to solve as many of these problems as possible in the allotted time (scheduled to be four hours). The team that correctly solves the most problems wins. If multiple teams solve the same number of problems, the team that solved them fastest wins. Expertise in quick-and-dirty hacking is usually more valuable than rigid software engineering techniques in such an environment. Experience with debugging stupid mistakes is also a plus. The contest is comprised of 4 levels of competitions: Local contests: Intra-university contest for selection of one or more teams to represent the universities at the next level of competition. Preliminary contests: Multi-university preliminary contests that advance teams to Regional contests. Regional contests: a total of 31 regional contests are held for teams around the world to compete for the opportunities for world finals. Worlds final: 72 winners of the regional contests will compete in the World Finals which will be held in Shanghai.

The award presentation ceremony was held on 5 May 2011 at HKUST. Entitled "A Convex Formulation of Modularity Maximization for Community Detection", the paper proposes a reformulation of an optimization problem for the 2-partition problem based on the modularity measure proposed previously for community detection. It can be extended naturally for tackling the general k-partition problem directly without tackling multiple 2-partition subproblems like other methods do. A convex relaxation scheme is used to give an iterative algorithm. Compared with some related methods, this method is both scalable and competitive in performance via maintaining a good trade-off between efficiency and quality. Prof. Dit-Yan YEUNG Prof. Dit-Yan YEUNG is a full professor in Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He obtained his PhD degree from the University of Southern California. After that he started his academic career at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and then joined the HKUST. CHAN Yun-Kwan Emprise Emprise is now doing his MPhil under the supervision of Prof. Yeung. His research interest is machine learning.

The project, titled "A Lean Wireless Infrastructure Network for Aviation and other Industries," has been under research and development over the past years and successfully transferred to local industries for commercial use. The award ceremony took place on 3 April 2012, in Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Official website and the winner list can be found at Hong Kong ICT Awards. Supported by Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong Productivity Council, and Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the HKICT Awards have been widely acknowledged by the industry. The awards have not only strengthened the image of HK ICT industry in both local and international market, but also provide great opportunities for the ICT elites to deliver their creative and innovative ICT ideas. According to its objective, "The Hong Kong ICT Awards recognise, promote and commend the excellent achievements to which Hong Kong ICT professionals and organisations contribute. The Awards also encourage local practitioners to develop innovative and creative ICT solutions, which will uplift the image of Hong Kong ICT sectors, both locally and internationally." LAviNet is a novel multi-hop wireless mesh network researched and developed by Prof. Gary Chan's team to offer pervasive Wi-Fi access. Traditionally, smart Access Points (APs) can cost-effectively cover only part of an area, but it is often difficult to eliminate all the blind spots. LAviNet can complement those APs by enabling wireless routers with adaptive and intelligent channel assignment and routing algorithms to offer ubiquitous wireless access. This research and development project has been sponsored by the Innovation Technology Fund of Hong Kong Government. The details of the project can be found at LAviNet.

Devices can exploit these direct communications for exchanging resources and assisting each other with the execution of demanding and context-aware tasks. In this context, the concepts of wisdom of crowd and collective intelligence have been utilized by mobile application developers to achieve distributed computation. The profitability of this method heavily depends on users' interactions and their willingness to share resources. Thus, different applications need to adopt mechanisms that motivate peers to collaborate and defray the costs of participating ones who share their resources. Although credit-based incentive schemes have been proposed for the compensation of mobile users and reputation mechanisms for the marginalization of selfish and malicious users, both are designed to operate via a centralised authority. In this thesis proposal, we advance the state of the art by presenting three works related to (i) the resource exchange, (ii) the reputation, and (iii) the credit transfer between mobile users, which do not rely on any centralised authority. In the first work, we introduce a framework that integrates an incentive scheme and a reputation mechanism for computation offloading in D2D ecosystems. The incentive scheme is a cryptocurrency, named FlopCoin, which is maintained by users called miners who are sharing their cloudlet resources for tasks of other users. In the second work, we present OPENRP, a lightweight and scalable system middleware that provides a unified interface to crowd computing and opportunistic networking applications. OPENRP evaluates and updates the reputation of participating peers based on their mutual opportunistic interactions and chooses the best peers with whom a device should collaborate. In the third work, we propose LocalCoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources, produces low data traffic, and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices. LocalCoin features (i) a lightweight proof-of-work scheme and (ii) a distributed blockchain, replacing the computational hardness that is at the root of Bitcoin's security with the social hardness of ensuring that all witnesses to a transaction are colluders. The quality of the three proposals is depicted through extensive simulations on real traces. In the first work, we show how collaborating devices get rewarded while selfish ones get sidelined. In the second work, we show that the traffic generated by the applications is lower compared to two benchmark strategies. Finally, in the last work we prove that under the assumption of sufficient number of mobile users and properly selected tuning parameters the probability of double spending in LocalCoin is close to zero.

The effectiveness of such collaborations depends on the characteristics of the selected devices, the willingness of their owners to help and the privacy losses of each participant. Thus, mobile systems need to adopt mechanisms that motivate collaboration and compensate those who share their resources while preserving their privacy. Research has proposed such mechanisms designed to operate via centralized authorities. I will discuss decentralized mechanisms that eliminate the need for authorities and function via specifically designed consensus protocols. These mechanisms enhance mobile ecosystems by facilitating the exchange of resources and storing interactions between mobile devices. I will present FlopCoin, a cryptocurrency operating as an incentive scheme for computation offloading and OPENRP, a lightweight and scalable middleware that provides a unified interface to mobile applications for reputation exchange. Next, I will introduce LocalCoin, a cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices accompanied with specifically designed consensus protocols designed for mobile ecosystems that can guarantee essential properties of a distributed ledger: persistence and liveness. Finally, I will introduce mobile systems that integrate smart contracts to guarantee integrity and transparency with applications on crowdsourcing, distributed file systems, and privacy-preserving marketplaces. ********************** Biography: Dimitris Chatzopoulos received his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and his Diploma and MSc in Computer Engineering and Communications from the University of Thessaly, Greece.

According to Google Scholar citations, the work has been cited for 2031 times. The work developed the first large-scale Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming system in the world. The key technology underpinning the Coolstreaming system was the data-driven overlay, also referred as swarming, which utilized a distributed gossip protocol to explore content availability with a small set of neighbors to form a random overlay for video retrieval. It resulted in a breakthrough from the conventional video broadcast paradigm in that some forms of multicast trees must be used. The random overlay in Coolstreaming achieved superior scaling comparing to the then state-of-the-art technologies. It made a quantum lump from supporting only hundreds of viewers to hundreds of thousands of viewers in the original Coolstreaming system reported in this work appeared in IEEE INFOCOM (2005). The commercial offering of Coolstreaming later was able to scale to support millions of viewers. The IEEE INFOCOM Test-of-Time Paper Award is newly launched this year to recognize the most frequently cited and widely recognized papers published in the past 10 to 12 years in the INFOCOM proceedings. The award will be presented in the opening ceremony of the 2015 INFOCOM Week in Hong Kong during 26 April - 1 May 2015.

Of course this is not automatic, the credit transfer must go through the normal credit transfer procedure If you are admitted in 2012-2013 or after, at least 9 credits should be single counted. In other words, they cannot be used to fulfil any other requirement except the 120 credits for graduation (e.g., you cannot count them towards the major, or any other minor, they must be purely for the IT minor) Special cases If you took in the past (prior to 2012-2013) the now defunct course COMP 1004 then you may use it to fulfill required course COMP 2011. If you took in the past (prior to 2011-2012) both COMP 1002 and COMP 1003 then you may use them to fulfill required course COMP 2011, and you'd be entitled to ONLY take 9 credits in electives! If you took the 4 credit course COMP 2012H (prior to 2014-2015) then you may request to use it to replace required course COMP 2012. If you took the 5 credit course COMP 2012H (in 2014-2015 or after) you may request to use it to replace both required courses COMP 2011 and COMP 2012. In this case you need to take extra electives to make up for the shortfall in the total number of credits. Clarifications on course codes equivalence prior to 2011-2012 2000 level corresponds to 100 level prior to 2011-2012 3000 level corresponds to 200 level prior to 2011-2012 4000 level corresponds to 300 level prior to 2011-2012 NB: The full official set of requirements can be found on the catalog - Undergraduate Minor Program in Information Technology; Please work out the prerequisites by yourself, see the list of COMP courses with their credits and prerequisites/co-requisites.

Prof. Lei Chen's research is motivated by new technologies and applications through mining/learning the spatial-temporal knowledge and exploiting the wisdom of crowds to facilitate people's daily life. By collaborating with DiDi Chuxing (the biggest online car-hailing company in Mainland China), Prof. Chen's team can utilize the huge amount of data generated by millions of drivers and customers to help the company improve the efficiency of their services and the user experience of both drivers and customers. One such service, ridesharing, which allows drivers to share their empty seats to different groups of customers as long as the detours are acceptable, has a huge potential to alleviate the shortage of vehicles and increase the throughput of the platform. With ridesharing, customers can enjoy relatively cheaper transportation services with guarantees, such as the suitability of fellow travelers and the deadline of delivery. However, to operate a good ridesharing service is challenging. Prof. Chen's team has helped DiDi to design smart vehicle dispatching strategies and dynamic pricing strategies such that the efficiency of the ridesharing service can be improved, and the overall profit of the platform can be increased. Prof. Chen's team also collaborates with WeChat (at Tencent) in exploiting the wisdom of humans to boost the performance of machine learning models. Recently, although many accurate models have been developed to recognize images, translate languages and compose songs (some models are even more accurate than humans in image recognition), humans are still better than machines in discovering errors, learning new items and feeling emotion. Prof. Chen's team has studied methods to combine the advantages of humans and machines to build better machine learning models benefitting our daily life with human feedback used to iteratively improve the current models.

They are characterized by the increasing complexities such as Volume (the quantity of data that is generated is very important in this context), Variety (the category to which Big Data belongs to), Velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands), and Veracity (the quality of the data being captured can vary greatly. Data sets grow in size in part because they are increasingly being gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing mobile devices, and computer and sensor networks. The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s. As of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5x1018) of data were created. Relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages often have difficulty in handling big data. Big Data Technology poses a grand challenge on the analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, learning and modeling, visualization, and information privacy of the Big Data. This includes the design of efficient and effective algorithms and systems to integrate the data and uncover large hidden values from datasets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale. Many breakthroughs are expected in this area in new algorithms, methodologies, systems and applications that discover useful and hidden knowledge from the Big Data efficiently and effectively and to do so in data sources across diverse areas of practice and applications. Objectives The educational objectives of this minor program are: To allow students to be aware of the major challenges and opportunities from Big Data Technology To equip students with the necessary skills to build tools to collect, manage and analyze the Big Data To introduce students to some applications of Big Data Technology Program Details For program requirements and further details refer to the catalog - Undergraduate Minor Program in Big Data Technology. Electives List The non-CSE course elective list is empty at the moment. Courses will be added here upon their approval as an elective.

We are looking for outstanding undergraduate students as well as graduate students with a Masters degree in Computer Science and related areas. According to the latest QS World University Rankings, HKUST is ranked the 32th globally, and our CSE department ranked the 26th worldwide in the Subject of Computer Science and Information Systems. Our department has produced pioneering work in several areas, including but not limited to, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data and knowledge management, human computer interaction, networks and distributed systems, software technologies, theoretical computer science and algorithms, and vision and graphics. Our department consists of over 50 faculty members, about 100 MPhil students and 280 PhD students. The MPhil study takes two years, and the PhD study four to five years. Many of our postgraduate alumni work at major IT companies such as Baidu, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, and Tencent, and a significant number of our PhD graduates pursue their careers at research institutes and universities all over the world. If interested, please check out the departmental web page on where do our PhD graduates go. Postgraduate students have sufficient scholarship support during their study at HKUST. The amount of scholarship is about HKD200,000 (USD25,500) per person per year. The School of Engineering selects excellent postgraduate students to award additional scholarship to cover the tuition. The annual tuition of a postgraduate student is HKD42,100 (USD5,300). Furthermore, the Hong Kong government selects incoming PhD students to award the prestigious Hong Kong PhD Fellowship (HKPF) each year. The amount of the HKPF is around HKD25,100 per month, plus a travel allowance of HKD12,600 each year. In addition, HKUST gives each awardee a one-time reward of HKD40,000. In the past, our department was awarded 8 to 10 HKPFs every year. Our postgraduate admissions require applicants to have good academic records in their areas of study and to have obtained a Bachelor's degree by the time of their HKUST enrollment. Applicants also need to satisfy the University English Language Requirements. We recruit postgraduate students in two phases. The first phase is early recruiting, targeted at excellent MPhil and PhD applicants through telephone or onsite interviews. To apply, you can fill out the preliminary application form (registration for early admission has closed) at the departmental early recruiting website. We will process these online applications and shortlist candidates to invite for on-site interviews. This year, the early admission interviews will start in September 2019. Applicants will be notified their interview results one to two weeks after their interviews. After the early recruiting phase, applicants can still send regular application packages to the HKUST Postgraduate Admissions. Finally, we encourage exceptional PhD applicants (top 10% in class, average grade higher than 85/100, excellent English) to contact us to inquire about the HKPF applications. Please find relevant information at the HKUST's HKPFS web site. If you have any questions, feel free to contact mmsend('pgrecruit'). FAQ Q1. I have not taken TOEFL/IELTS now, can I apply in this early recruit session? Yes. You are eligible to apply. However, if you are admitted, you should meet our departments' English requirements before enrollment. Q2. When is the deadline for early admission application? For full consideration, please submit your application by Aug 31 (Sep 30 Oct 7 for applicants to be interviewed in Seoul). Applications received after this date will be processed if quota is available. Q3. When and where is the interview? This year's interviews are scheduled as follows: Beijing (Aug 31), Shanghai (Sep 7), Shenzhen (Sep 14), and Seoul (Oct 19)* If you are shortlisted, you will be notified by email inviting you to one of the interviews. * For applicants to be interviewed in Seoul, applications by Sep 30 Oct 7 will receive full consideration. Q4. When will I get the offer? The first batch of offers will be made to exceptional applicants around Sep 21 (Oct 26 for applicants interviewed in Seoul). After the first batch, offers will be sent out on a continuous basis as soon as decisions are made, usually with the support from a prospective advisor. Q5. I have not received an offer in the first batch, should I contact individual faculty members? Mass emails to the faculty are unlikely to be effective (they receive many such emails). All your application materials will be made available to the faculty, so there is no need to send them again. Thus, if you would like to contact individual faculty members, please try to differentiate your email from hundreds of others: Why are you interested in his/her research? What qualities of yours make you a good student of his/hers? If you have read one of his/her papers, do you have some comments and further ideas? Read more about General Admission FAQ.

In contrast to "theoretical" or fundamental research, my team has been working closely with companies to study and develop novel, distributed and deployment-ready systems which advance the field. We apply rigorous algorithmic and optimization techniques to relentlessly close practice-theory gaps so that our systems operate under the most general and realistic network environment. The systems we developed are not simply proof-of-concept prototypes, but can be fully integrated into industrial operations with unmatched performance in their running. I keep a strong team of researchers (postdocs, PhD and MPhil candidates) and regular engineering staff, whose work closely knit together so that our research results drive engineering excellence while deployment challenges drive our research agenda. Our work has been extensively supported by leading companies such as Boeing, China Mobile, Cisco, Google, HAECO, HP, Huawei, Modern Terminals Ltd. (HK), Mei Ah Entertainment, Microsoft, TCL, Tencent, etc. Widely known for their practical nature, my projects have won several awards and been of direct impact to industry. They have been demonstrated and deployed with remarkable success.

Every year, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) sponsors regional and international collegiate programming contests. They divide the world into several regions. Each region has a number of regional contests and only the top two or three teams in each regional contest enter into the world finals. Since 1991, the ACM Hong Kong Chapter has been organizing a local contest in Hong Kong, modeling after the ACM contests in terms of objectives, format, and style. This year, 8 local tertiary institutes participated in this contest held on 16 July at the Caritas Institute of Higher Education. Each team was assigned six programming problems. The teams tried to solve as many of these problems as possible before the time limit. The team which correctly solved the most problems in the shortest time was the champion. To solve the problems, the teams have to combine a variety of algorithmic techniques with quick-and-dirty programming tricks. After 4 hours of intensive and competitive programming, the CSE team won the championship.

Covering topics in the areas of foundations of computer science and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, networking, computer graphics, multimedia computing, software and web technologies, and data and knowledge-base systems, the Computer Science programs at this University are dedicated to educate students and to advance research in computer and information technology; as well as to assist in the development and growth of the information industry in the region. Through the efforts of researchers and engineers, computers have evolved from large, slow, expensive, and very specialized systems to small, fast, affordable, and ordinary tools that are part of virtually everyone's life. Advances in networking technologies and human-computer interfacing technologies have further created a digital culture. The ubiquitous nature of computers in today's workplace and home environment is making computer literacy a requirement not only for all professionals in industrial societies but also for everybody living in the digital culture. Computer Science is still a young field. Although we have witnessed numerous advances in the past, this is only the beginning of a new revolution as the potential of information technology has not yet been fully realized. Information technology is in the midst of a revolution as we move from explicit interactions with disconnected computing devices to implicit and pervasive interactions with highly interconnected, integrated digital resources embedded in the environments in which we work, live, learn, and play. The impact of computer science and information engineering will be broad and deep. Computer Science programs at HKUST prepare students for exciting challenges and new opportunities that help to bring such impact to our lives. The Department offers a full range of courses to meet the needs of its own students and those from other departments. Its programs lead to the BEng, BSc, MSc, MPhil, and PhD degrees. Aside from taking computer science courses, students are encouraged to design individual study plans tailored to their own interests.

The projects also aim to develop the capabilities of students in analyzing and solving complex and possibly real-case problem and to develop the skills of students in the systematic development, documentation and presentation of a significant piece of work. Our department encourages industry partners to propose industrial FYPs with our department. Each project requires an internal faculty supervisor from CSE, HKUST. If companies/institutions are interested to collaborate with our department and have already identified a CSE faculty member, the company/institution may approach the faculty member directly. If companies/institutions have not yet identified nor approached our faculty members, the company/institution may fill in the Industry FYP Proposal form and send to mmsend('fyp'). Our department would help identify a suitable advisor for the project. As students would be assigned to projects in early April, the collection time of Industry FYP proposals would be 1 Feb - 31 March every year. For enquiries, please contact mmsend('fyp').

TITLE: Towards Understanding of Engagement in Human-Robot Interaction | HKUST CSE
https://www.cse.ust.hk/pg/research/projects/mxj/hri/

One of the most straightforward and effective ways is through its eyes, i.e., the cameras. The HKUST HCI Initiative thus conducted a series of HRI research to equip robots with the ability to visually perceive human status on different scales, from eyes, faces and to body poses. In natural human-human interactions, people make eye contacts from time to time to deliver very rich information to each other, e.g., attention, interest, etc. HCI Initiative studied how to estimate the level of boredom/sleepiness - attentional engagement - of participants in real-time HRI by temporal modeling of typical eye-related movements, i.e., eyelid and eyeball motions. Compared to eyes, faces provide more fine-grained information of one's shifts of attentional engagement. For an interactive robot, it needs to constantly check whether participants are facing towards it and whether they are still engaged with current interactions. HCI Initiative proposed an approach to sense participants' engagement transitions by modeling the dynamics of their face orientations as well as other social signals. Through face modeling, a robot could effectively detect engagement changes when the participants get distracted by peripheral devices. In addition to attentional engagement, faces are also highly indicative of affective engagement in interactions. In order to be emotionally intelligent, a robot should also be sensitive to such status. Many studies have used facial movements to recognize the type of emotional expressions. However, even when the same affect is shown, its intensity may fluctuate over time. HCI Initiative intends to capture the largely overlooked intensity of emotional engagement from rich gesture and body posture expressions. Thus, a model to combine body poses and faces is developed to help a robot to "feel" the subtle emotional fluctuations of its human partners throughout their interaction. The model has been tested empirically and the robot appeared to be more sensitive to changes in human emotion and thus perceived to be more emotionally intelligent. Besides being able to infer human engagement, a robot should also ensure that its human partners can understand the robot itself. A robot is still far from embracing "humanness" in interactions if its movements or motions are unreadable and/or unpredictable for human beings. How can a robot effectively express its intents, its engagement or even its "smartness" via movements and motions so that it can be understood and trusted by human partners? To this end, HCI Initiative developed a set of rule-based robot action strategies. In one user study, a robot was designed to behave either explicitly or implicitly when trying to deliver its intents. For example, when the robot detects the engagement shifts of human beings, it would react with pauses in the implicit mode, or it would speak out directly in the explicit mode. Results show that the participants always appreciated when a robot could acknowledge their engagement shift. A second user study investigated how a robot should respond to its partner's affective fluctuations. The robot was equipped with two styles of emotional responses: it can react by speech only (verbal) or it can use speech together with expressive gestures/postures (verbal+). Results suggest that verbal responses are sufficient in some occasions while gesture/postures are more effective for robots to show empathy. By applying these reaction strategies, robots are more understandable in simple interaction scenarios. HCI Initiative is exploring more complex and interesting practical applications, by exploiting more rigorous mathematical modeling and more effective algorithms.

Here is a brief summary of my research statement to summarize some of my research topics with their contributions and impacts. 1. Knowledge Discovery Applications of Data Mining During my master degree, I focused on studying the "utility" of data mining. Most traditional data mining techniques find many different "patterns". For example, association rules and clustering are typical patterns in data mining. However, these patterns cannot directly be used for decision making which is the main objective of data mining. The focus of my research work about knowledge discovery is how to utilize these kinds of traditional patterns in data mining. More specifically, in my work published in ICDM03, association rule mining which are studied extensively in the literature of data mining aims at understanding the relationship among items in a basket analysis. The focus of our work is to find a set of items in order to maximize the profit of the company with the use of the traditional patterns in applications of inventory control and marketing. The concept of the "utility" of data mining gives a lot of opportunities to researchers to work on many new problems which utilize the traditional data mining patterns. Data Streams After I graduated my master degree, I continued working on top-K itemsets mining over data streams and published papers in Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. In the literature of data mining, association rule mining is very popular because of the ease of understanding the relationship among items. However, it suffers from a major drawback of setting a "magic" number of the user-defined threshold which is used to determine whether an association rule is "interesting" or not. Setting this magic number depends on the characteristics of data. Setting too high gives no association rules at all but setting too low gives abundant association rules. Setting a reasonable threshold is troublesome because it may involve a lot of steps for "trying". These "trying" steps can only be used in the static data but they cannot be used over data streams because, in data streams, all data can be read once only and cannot be read back again. From the perspective of human, the number of "interesting" association rules should be roughly equal to a certain size K given by the users. In this way, the users can just give a parameter K and K "interesting" association rules can be returned as desired. My work focuses on mining top-K association rules (or simply frequent patterns) over data streams. It is different from all "magic" number dependent techniques about association rule mining over data streams. The utilization of "top-K" is not only meaningful to human but also useful with data streams where the data characteristics are unknown. 2. Database Queries Skyline Queries One of my recent research works published in KDD07 is skyline queries. All traditional skyline queries are based on totally-ordered numeric attributes. However, in many existing applications, there are some categorical attributes in which the ordering or preference of values is different with different users. For example, when we select air flights, some categorical attributes are airline and transition airport. Due to the inability of the existing techniques to solve this new problem, we propose some methods to handle it. Since our proposed problem is much general than the traditional problems, all variations of the traditional problems such as finding skyline over data streams and find skyline with respect to any subspace can be some of the potential research problems when categorical attributes are considered. Spatial Matching Queries In my recent work published in VLDB07, I proposed a spatial matching problem which is a general problem of an extensively studied problem in the literature of spatial database, reverse nearest neighbor. My major contribution in this paper is that this work brings the researchers an attention to consider the maximum serving capacity of each service in all customer-service applications which are not considered in all existing works related to reverse nearest neighbor. We prove that our spatial matching problem is a general problem of (bichromatic) reverse nearest neighbor. Thus, all existing works related to reverse nearest neighbors can also be extended with the consideration of the capacities of services. Some examples are finding reverse nearest neighbors in real time and finding reverse nearest neighbors of moving objects with the consideration of the capacities. 3. Privacy Issues One of my research topics is privacy. Publishing sensitive data is an important topic in the literature of privacy. The major task of data publishing is to release data which can protect individual privacy. At the same time, the "utility" of the released data can be kept as high as possible and thus the "distortion" or "information loss" of the released data should be minimized. My recent work published in VLDB07 points out that individual privacy breaches when the minimality principle is used in the anonymization. Since all existing works rely on this principle, all published tables defined by the existing works suffer from privacy breaches. Thus, since all existing works are affected, their works should be re-done with the consideration of the minimality principle during data publishing in order to protect individual privacy.

Novorésumé Novoresume is a website that offers a well-researched and free guide to writing a resume Should you prepare a Resumé or a CV? When you apply for a job, note carefully whether the employer requests a curriculum vitae (CV) or a resumé (also called a résumé or resume.) In some countries, a resumé and a CV are the same thing - a document listing your qualifications for employment. In other countries, however, a resumé often has a more free-form organizational style and is used for seeking employment in private companies, but a CV is more standardized in format and is used for seeking positions in academic or educational institutions. For example, a resumé may begin with a statement about your personal goal(s) and then list your most significant accomplishments and/or skills in order of significance; a CV, however, often includes more complete lists of data, such as educational institutions attended, degrees received, positions held, professional affiliations, publications authored, etc. Help from your CT If you want help, your CT can help you edit your resumé/CV and your cover letter or help you practice having an interview. First, please read some of the tips from Jobstar, OWL and the Job Hunter's Bible. Next, spend a few hours writing your resumé/CV and cover letter.

The degree awarded - BEng, BSc, BBA - will be the one associated with their first major. The Computer Science and Engineering Department offers two programs, both of which can be additional majors. They are COMP: The default CSE major. When taken as a first major it offers a Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng). When taken with a BEng degree it is accredited by the HKIE; and COSC: Designed to be taken as one of a double (or even triple) major degree. When taken as a first major it offers a Bachelor of Science degree (BSc). Not accredited as an Engineering degree. Additional Major(s) for Currently Enrolled COMP Students Students registered as COMP majors should first talk with the UG Coordinator to decide if they should have COMP as their first major or first switch to COSC. The COSC page provides more details of this process. They may pursue additional major(s) if they successfully fulfill the degree requirements of the additional major; they are approved by the department of the additional major; and they are approved by the UG coordinator of CSE department no later than the last day of the add/drop period in the first regular term of their final year of study. Independent of the degree of the additional major(s), the degree students will receive is BEng (if they are registered in COMP) or BSc (if they are registered in COSC). Non-CSE Students Pursuing An Additional Major in CSE For other students (i.e., students NOT pursuing COMP/COSC as their first major), they may pursue an additional major in COMP or COSC if they successfully fulfill the COMP or COSC major requirements; they are approved by the UG coordinator of CSE department no later than the last day of the add/drop period in the first regular term of their final year of study; and they are approved by the department of their first major. In such case, the degree the students graduate with would follow the degree associated with their first major. Major Selection for First-Year SENG Students If you are a 1st year SENG student who would like to choose COMP or COSC in the CSE department to double major, you should discuss with the CSE UG Coordinator to decide and get approval on which COMP or COSC to pursue; and discuss with the UG Coordinator of the other major to get their approval. After receiving approval from both departments and if you decide to put COMP or COSC as your first major, put CSE down as your first choice during the Major Selection exercise toward the end of your first year. If you get assigned to CSE you will then be able to jumpstart your COMP or COSC program as your first major.

The award encourages us to further devote ourselves in application development. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitute to our FYP advisor, Prof. Samuel Chanson, and Cyberspace Center, for providing valuable guidance in the project.", the team said. PDA Trip Planner This project is a real-world application using PDA with Pocket PC 2002/2003 operating system as device. Similar initiatives are already used in France, Korea and Macau. It aims at developing an PDA-based electronic "In-transit Guide" for tourists or transit passengers in Hong Kong and provides useful information with interactive capabilities for users. They have made use of multimedia presentations such as text, sound, images, maps, and videos to create greater impact on tourists in the shortest time. Another part, called "Itinerary Planner", is capable of scheduling tours for users based on their time constraints and preferences. Users can specify their personal preferences, with the scoring method and graph-based technique, to generate suggested tour routes which can maximize their own satisfaction and minimize the required travel time. Backend server modules are built to support data maintenance and application deployment. This project has been adopted by the Hong Kong Tourism Board to explore potential application in electronic travelling guides. Last year, another FYP "Mobile Commerce — Digital Meeting Support System", developed by Hung Lau Yung, Ip Tak Shun and Siu Po Wa had received "The Best Application of Internet Technologies Award" of IiTEC 2003. This project was also supervised by Prof. Samuel Chanson. Intervarsity Internet Technologies Exposition and Conference (IiTEC) is an annual event organized for talented students from different tertiary institutions to display their ingenious Final Year Projects (FYP) in a high-profile and public occasion to capture business opportunities created therein. IiTEC 2003 was organized by the Junior Committee of Internet Professionals Association (iProA) and co-organized by six local tertiary institutions.

April Checklist for FYP/FYT Work Below is a possible checklist for you to finish up well. Not all of the items will apply to you or your group, and only three or four items are actually mandatory. Most are just suggestions. Testing If you need volunteer testers, then: Recruit some friends ASAP (the more the better) If it's appropriate and within your budget, hire people on Amazon Mechanical Turk to do testing for you. Collect photos and/or video clips of the testing process (regardless of who does it). Prepare an online questionnaire for user feedback (e.g., Google Forms) and ask the testers to complete it. For web applications, use a free dead link checker to identify any broken or invalid links Writing the Final Report Schedule a meeting with your communication tutor (CT) regarding your progress report and final report. Write your final report, making the changes suggested by your CT, if appropriate. Check out report examples related to your project (if any). Read the instructions for the Final Report and try to understand what is required for three new sections: Abstract, Discussion and Conclusions Run a spell check in MS Word to check your spelling. Send your final report draft to your FYP advisor and ask for his/her advice. Submit your final report before the deadline. Preparing for the Oral Presentation Watch videos of oral presentations for projects similar to yours. Prepare your oral presentation outline and PowerPoint (or Prezi) slides, condensing your final report into a 20-25 minute talk. (Some extra slides for Q&A time may also be a good idea). If possible, prepare a live demo. Live demos for Android apps can be done via the Android SDK or other Android emulators like these. Live demos for iOS apps can be done via the iOS similator in Xcode or other iOS similators like these. For some projects, it may be necessary to produce a pre-recorded demo video. Be sure to discuss your approach with your FYP or FYT advisor. If it would be helpful, make a demo video to show during your presentation. Practice the entire presentation at least two times privately as a group, recording a videos and then watching them together to evaluate yourselves. If possible, practice at least once with your advisor, CT or friends to get some comments. Practice in the venue of actual presentation a few days in advance to make sure that everything works OK. IMPORTANT NOTE: IN 2020, ALL PRESENTATIONS WILL BE DONE ONLINE VIA ZOOM, SO PRACTICE ON ZOOM BEFOREHAND. Making a Project Video If possible, be taking photos and/or video clips of your project development so people can visualize what you did. According to your type of project, capture videos with a camera or screen capturing software. Still shots can be good too; pick the best ones. Edit the video clips with tools like Camtasia, OfficeMix, iMovie, MS Movie Maker, Adobe Premiere Pro or Goanimate.com (for DIY animations). For more information, see FYP/FYT Short Video. Miscellaneous Submit your individual self-assessment reports (only for FYP groups of 2-4 students). Useful Links CSE Dept.

DATE: Thu, 12 Sep 2019 10:34:47 GMT, 12441
Home Publications Projects Teaching Students Bio Contact Prof. Pan Hui (ACM Distinguished Scientist - IEEE Fellow - Member Academia Europaea) I am the Nokia Chair in Data Science ( with a generous endowment from Nokia) and a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. I am also the director of the HKUST-DT System and Media Laboratory (SyMLab) at Computer Science and Engineering Department of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology since January 2013. Currently, I am on leave from my teaching and administrative duties at HKUST, but I am still leading my research team there. I am splitting my time between Hong Kong and Helsinki (homepage) and run a very international team with frequent research exchanges between Asia and Europe. I was a Senior Research Scientist and then a Distinguished Scientist with Deutsche Telekom Innovation Laboratories, Berlin Germany. I am an ACM Distinguished Scientist, an IEEE Fellow (Computer Society & Communications Society), and a member of Academia Europaea (Academy of Europe). I also served on the 2018 IEEE Computer Society Fellows Evaluation Committee. As, over the years, I have conducted research at University of Helsinki, HKUST, Aalto University, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, University of Cambridge, Thomson Research Paris, Intel Research Cambridge, and University of Hong Kong, my publications have covered a wide spectrum of topics including mobile computing, networking, social networks, network science, cloud computing, and augmented reality. A common theme underlying all of them is "Data Science for Sociotechnical Systems", which further categorizes my research into two major topics: Data-driven Systems Design and Immersive Human-Data Interaction, covering three objectives: 1.) Using empirical big data to model human behaviors and gain deep insights into social and sociotechnical systems, and then further design better software systems with the evidences; 2.) Building energy efficient, high performance, and scalable software for mobile, wearable devices, and cloud systems with a data-driven approach; 3.) Developing Mobile Augmented Reality algorithms and systems for immersive data visualization and human-data interaction. I am an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (since 2014) and the Springer journal of Computational Social Networks. I have also served as Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing (2014 - 2018) and guest editor for various journals including IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC), IEEE Transactions on Secure and Dependable Computing, IEEE Communications Magazine, and ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications. I have also served as track chair, senior program committee member, organising committee member, and program committee member of many top conferences such as ACM WWW, ACM SIGCOMM, ACM Mobisys, ACM MobiCom, ACM CoNext, IEEE Infocom, IEEE ICNP, IEEE ICDCS, IJCAI, AAAI, and ICWSM. I am looking for top and motivated candidates for PhD and Postdocs for both University of Helsinki and HKUST to work on Augmented-Reality (AR), Mobile Computing, Social Networks or some other interesting Machine Learning/data mining applications. We are establishing the dual PhD programme so a qualified candidate can receive PhD degrees from both HKUST and University of Helsinki with the same thesis. I am also interested into hiring excellent interns to work on some researches of mutual interest together. Interested and qualified candidates may like to send me their CV and Statement of Purpose (SOP). You can reach me through my HKUST email address (panhuiATcse.ust.hk) or my Helsinki email address (panhuiATcs.helsinki.fi) Besides research, I like nature and a little bit of adventures. In 2002, I have cycled across Tibet for around 4500 KM. That was tough but fantastic. I have also organised a series of Extreme Conferences on Communications and Computing (ExtremeCom 2009, ExtremeCom 2010, ExtremeCom 2011, ExtremeCom 2012, ExtremeCom 2013, ExtremeCom 2014). Updates We received a Distinguished Paper Award from UbiComp 2019. (Picture Here). Elevated as Member of Academia Europaea (Academy of Europe) 2019, for significant contributions to foundations, software systems and innovative applications for mobile computing and communications. I am leading the H2O initiative (Hong Kong - Helsinki Oasis for Innovation and Technology) to establish an AI research centre in Hong Kong. (Media 1, Media 2 (English), Media 3, Finland - Hong Kong Summit) Elevated as IEEE Fellow (Class 2018), for contributions to social-based opportunistic network. Elected as ACM Distinguished Scientist 2016, for contributions to mobility modelling and routing in opportunistic networking.

The videos are intended to provide an overview of your project/thesis to non-specialists of various kinds on different occasions. They will be used in Open-House presentations, and may also be displayed in department channel (department website, YouTube), undergraduate information day, and etc. Video File Format and Submission Each group is required to submit the video file in MPEG-4 format. Suggested video length is 3 minutes. The video should begin with the project/thesis title and code, the names of the group members, and the names of the supervisors. The narration (if any) should be in English. The subtitles (if any) can be in English or Bilingual (English and Chinese). Upload Instructions (for Windows 10 and MacOS): Make sure your video file is in .mp4 format. Name your file as <project_code>.mp4. Open a command prompt (Windows 10) or a terminal (MacOS). Upload your video file with a command: $ scp </path/to/file.mp4> <username>@<hostname>:/csproject/fyp19video/<project_code> where </path/to/file.mp4>: full path to your .mp4 video file <username>: your CSE UNIX account name <hostname>: any of csl2wk01.cse.ust.hk, ..., csl2wk52.cse.ust.hk <project_code>: your FYP/FYT project code (in lower case) for example: $ scp c:\myvideo\ach1.mp4 tmchanaa@csl2wk01.cse.ust.hk:/csproject/fyp19video/ach1 To verify if your file is uploaded, you may ssh to any csl2wkXX machine and list the upload directory with a command: $ ssh <username>@<hostname> 'ls -l /csproject/fyp19video/<project_code>' for example: $ ssh tmchanaa@csl2wk01.cse.ust.hk 'ls -l /csproject/fyp19video/ach1' For more information about using SSH/SCP/SFTP, please check here Please note: We accept one .mp4 file only. Any group member may upload the video file for their group. The upload host can be any of csl2wk01.cse.ust.hk, ..., csl2wk52.cse.ust.hk. The upload path /csproject/fyp19video will be mounted on demand. You can still "cd /csproject/fyp19video/<project_code>" directly even though "ls /csproject" shows nothing.

Comments from FYP Winners Each year, the CSE department selects 5 to 10 winning FYPs. You can see the posters of previous winning FYPs inside the glass cases outside Room 3558. Some of the winners were kind enough to share what helped them the most. Tourism Based Social Networking Service 2010-2011, NI1: Xie Tianyi and Wang Bo This group developed a real social networking service (SNS) that allows users to plan for sightseeing in major cities in China and also invite friends to join them. Xie Tianyi attributed the group's success to lots of hard work. They had a clear goal, started early to work towards their goal, kept working according to their schedule and also worked efficiently. He estimated that they each worked on the project for an average of 4 hours per day for 6 months, i.e., maybe around 600 man hours each. His advice to future FYP groups is to set a suitable goal, start early so as to allow sufficient time to debug and comfortably deal with the requirements of FYP. For more information about this project, see the project poster. Voicemaps: A Collaborative Android App Providing an Online Google Map with Audible Cantonese Pronunciations for Expats and Tourists in HK 2010-2011, MU3: Cheung Ka Chun, Wong Chun Yim and Yuen Siu Hung This app solves a common problem faced by expats and tourists in Hong Kong: communicating to local citizens, especially taxi drivers, when they want to go to various tourist attractions or popular places. When users tap on a location on the Google maps of Hong Kong, the system displays the place name in the three languages. Then, the users can tap to hear the pronunciation in English, Cantonese or Putonghua. The system utilizes a built in Android text-to-speech (TTS) engine for English, an open source TTS engine for Putonghua and a custom-made TTS engine for Cantonese. The system maintains a history of places tapped by the user, and it also links to a tourist board, so users can view additional useful information. The app's text menus are available in English, Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese. Cheung Ka Chun said that it was very important for his group to spend a significant about of time at the beginning of the project doing an in-depth literature survey instead of jumping into the coding. He said that an in-depth literature survey was very important to evaluate the feasibility of various techniques for solving difficult problems. For instance, they used an open source text-to-speech (TTS) engine and Google and Foursquare's web services instead of building custom databases for audible pronunciations and location retrieval. This saved much time. They also did much brainstorming throughout the project, inviting ideas each group member, their advisor and CT. This kept them motivated and made the project enjoyable. Cheung Ka Chun said he probably spent at least 14 hours per week during the first half of the project and then about 9 hours per week during the remaining half. Wong Chun Yim and Yuen Siu Hung also worked hard, so in general the group did not need to rush before the deadline. Future FYP groups would do well; to try to follow this group's example. Cheung Ka Chun also said that a collaborative online daily log was helpful for writing FYP reports, coding and fixing bugs. It was the group's creative way of writing good minutes. For more information about this project, you can watch presentation video or you can see the project poster. Using Knowledge Discovery to Generate Melodies for New Chinese Lyrics 2010-2011, RAYW3: Sze Ka Wai, Leung Yan Shing, Lui Man Fung and Woo Kai Ho In order to assist aspiring Chinese song composers, this group developed a novel approach to match the spoken tones of Chinese lyrics to the melodies of popular Chinese songs and then generate a suitable melody. Their system relies on a MIDI dataset of over a thousand of Chinese pop songs, and it adopts data mining techniques to extract frequent patterns and frequent rhythms from pop songs. When a user provides lyrics, the system reads the Chinese tones and generates a sweet melody according to a learning model. Sze Ka Wai said that design, organization and teamwork were important factors leading to the group's success. The most important factor in producing a winning FYP may have been not just trying to satisfy the stated requirements of the supervisor but also adding some interesting or useful functions. In their case, they not only developed a melody generator based on user-provided lyrics but also developed a melody editor. The group worked hard, putting in around 500 combined man hours. They also had around 12 meetings with their supervisor. Sze Ka Wai suggested that future FYP groups work hard and work smart for the project. He said that groups should not hesitate to ask their supervisor for advice. This can help a lot when facing difficulties. From his experience, he also thinks that for software projects it is important to focus a lot on the user interface and functions, because the appearance affects user's first impression, and the functions are users' main concern. For more information about this project, you can watch presentation video or see the project poster. Robotic RFID Stocktaking System 2010-2011, SC4: Wong Kai Hang, Leung Chun Yin and Leung Lok Ping This project was a cyber-physical system that included a mobile robot capable of performing inventory stocktaking in a warehouse via RFID scanning. The robot was carefully designed to operate on a rough or bumpy surface, and users can control it via the Internet. Wong Kai Hang said that good planning was very important for the group's success. He wrote, "Plan ahead. I mean really ahead. We started discussing our FYP since last summer. In this academic year we had schedules that made our FYP delayed. But planning ahead of time allowed us to adjust our pace." Leung Chun Yin said that research, planning and good time and step management were keys to the group's success. A schedule is good tool, but there are always accidents and delays in a big project, so planning for these and leaving enough time for the project management is important. Having alternative solutions for solving problems is also one of the keys. Lastly, success comes from having good teammates and teamwork. Leung Lok Ping said that good planning and good teammates were the primary keys to success. Good planning meant planning for the worst case. This reduced pressure during the implementation stage. One quality of good teammates is attitude. For example, when facing a problem or some sort of failure, it is important to focus on finding solutions not laying blame, which is usually counter-productive. Wong Kai Hang encouraged future FYP groups to think big. Although there is a risk that the project might not be finished in the given time, it helps to know what to do at the beginning and what to give up when necessary. Les Brown once said, "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars." Leung Chun Yin encouraged future FYP groups to plan for the worst and aim for the best. He also encouraged students to think outside the box - don't just think about the target that needs to be met - think beyond the target. He suggested trying to think about further improvements that can be made and new functions or features that can be added. He also added that it is important for FYP groups to choose a project that they are really interested in and like. Leung Lok Ping encouraged future FYP groups to not set any limits when they are thinking and problem solving. If one solution doesn't work or is not practical, then give up and find a better way to do deal with the problem. For more information about this project, you can watch presentation video or see the project poster. Time-Travel On the Internet Via An Internet Archiving System 2010-2011, LINGU1: Tang Siu Leung, Chan Lut Yan, Yeung Cheuk Yuen and Yip Kai Ho Internet browsing enables people to locate a myriad of information, but web pages are continually updated, so it is usually impossible to view archived web pages, i.e., the historic page layouts and old content. This project implemented an Internet archiving system to allow virtual "time travel on the Internet." The system included several functions: a web crawler (to download all web pages from seed sites), a rate limiter (to ensure a smooth downloading rate without any risk of overusing server bandwidth), a link converter (to convert universal links to links on our local server), an information extractor (to store the important content on the local server), an indexer (to organize the archived information) and a user-friendly interface. Tang Siu Leung identified 8 factors that were important for FYP success. He said the first three were the most basic ones: Learn well - do enough research to understand relevant concepts and utilize others' knowledge. Think well - for both planning and problem-solving, this is often more important than doing. Work hard - group members contributed around 250 hours each, and the leader put in over 400 hours. Consider different perspectives - in the design phase it was helpful to consider possible implementation techniques from different perspectives, including extensibility, separability and time requirements; this helped in the selection of a suitable design. Meet advisor regularly - this helped the group clarify expectations, learn from the advisor's wealth of knowledge and gain some gentle pressure and motivation to work hard on the project. Communication - this led to more information exchange and inspiration between group members; it also aided efficiency and the pace of progress. Flexibility - this is essential, because during different phases of the project the design of the system may have to change due to hardware constraints or limitations of the programming language; sometimes, new ideas are essential to overcome hurdles and move forward in the development. Project selection - choosing a suitable project helps make the work enjoyable. For more information about this project, you see the project poster. Finding the Shortest Path at HKUST 2009-2010, RAYW1: Chow Kwan Wang, Liu Hung Ho, Ng Wai Ying and So Siu Wing This project was a web-based application that helps normal users find their way around the HKUST academic building. Liu Hung Ho said that the project was a success because the group tried to make the system robust, user-friendly and fast. For instance, they utilized the map dragging concept made popular by Google Maps, and they pre-computed all shortest paths between the 5000 vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm and stored them in a plain text file so as to optimize response time. The group had 11 formal meetings from June to April, and most were with Professor Wong. This means they averaged about one meeting per month. Liu Hung Ho estimated that the four group members did not spend more than 300 combined man hours on the project. This means that they each spent an average of less than 2 hours per week. For them, working smart was more important than working hard. (Note: another group did the same project and used around 1000 hours, but they didn't win, since they used less powerful tools that yielded less beautiful results.) Liu Hung Ho's main advice for future FYP groups is to do sufficient research before starting, determine the key factors that will make the project a success and then try to get them done one by one. For more information about this project, see the presentation video or the project poster. In-Network Data Processing for Wireless Sensor Networks 2009-2010, LINGU1: Lau Wing Lok, Mak Long Ping and Wan Shu Fung This group built an accurate and sensitive indoor security system that utilized a wireless sensor network with various components and devices, including an accelerometer, a light sensor, a rotatable camera and a base station. The system automatically detected unauthorized persons entering a room, sent warning messages and recorded real time video. Mak Long Ping said that choosing an interesting topic and having a well-designed schedule were the key points that made their project a bit better than others. They had to do a lot of hardware testing, so hard work was also important. He said that each of the three members spent at least 500 hours on the project. That's an average of over 10 hours per week per person. Time with Professor Gu Lin was also invaluable. The group had 17 formal meetings from June to April, and almost all of them were with Professor Gu. Mak Long Ping suggested that future FYP groups try to have meetings with their project supervisors regularly so as to know their supervisors' expectations clearly. Every FYP supervisor has years of valuable experience that students can learn from, but students need to be proactive in seeking help. For more information about this project, see the presentation video or the project poster. Gigapixel Image Viewer for a Multi-Display Array Controlled by a Wii Remote 2009-2010, PSAN1: Lee Ning Hin Lincoln, Lou Yu Hong and Wu Kam Kong This project used a twelve-display array to display gigapixel images, and it used a Wii Remote for panning, tilting and zooming the images. Each of the twelve displays was controlled by a single computer and was connected to a high-speed network. A controller program synchronized the clients based on a protocol designed by the group, so the twelve displays were able to work together as a single large display unit. Lincoln said that the keys to their project's success were their development tools, teamwork, project planning and working closely with their FYP advisor. For the project development, they established a centralized revision control system, including a wiki and an SVN, to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. They also utilized a bug tracking system, which was very helpful during the implementation phase. Lincoln said that this infrastructure is essential for most open-source software development, and you can get free hosting apps from http://sourceforge.net/ if the project is open-source. The group probably put in over 800 hours for the entire project, so team member collaboration was very important. Every member had clearly-defined and separate responsibilities, and they put a lot of trust in each other and their project manager, Professor Pedro Sander. This method was risky. If one member had failed to complete his part, the whole team's FYP would fail. However, the three members had already worked together on projects in COMP111 and COMP 231, so they were familiar with each others' working styles. Groups without such collaborative experience may need to carefully evaluate each other to avoid a painful ordeal. Project planning was also important, but this particular project had a large number of unknowns, so adaptability, good leadership from the project advisor and the ability to think outside the box were more important. For more information about this project, see the presentation video or the project poster. Lego Robot Guided by Wi-Fi Devices 2009-2010, QYA2: Li Chun Kit and So Hung Wai This project did much more than the standard wireless remote control of a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot. It also performed automatic data collection, localization and self guidance. The system utilized a PDA attached to the robot. The PDA communicated with the robot using bluetooth and communicated with a controller PC and Wi-Fi access points via a Wi-Fi network at HKUST. The group collected 50 sets of RSSI data for their access point database. They also programmed the system to scan the RSSI values of access points several times, calculate the mean for each one and then perform location estimation using a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm. They then utilized a breadth first search shortest path algorithm to automatically guide the robot from a starting point to a destination on a map. With the help of the robot's ultrasonic sensor, the system was able to detect obstacles in the path and re-route the robot so it could bypass most small obstacles. Li Chun Kit and So Hung Wai think that the key to their success was their determination to implement the system despite difficulties faced. These difficulties included dealing with signal strength errors, selecting a suitable localization estimation algorithm, automatically collecting RSSI data, dealing with problems associated with a carpeted surface in the testing environment, dealing with mechanical errors of the robot which prevented it from moving in a straight line and resolving compatibility problems with the PDA software. The team got off to a slow start but finally got motivated in January. They estimated that from January to May they each spent 10 hours per week on average, so for the whole project they easily spent over 300 combined hours for the entire project. They gave the following advice for future FYP groups: Start your project early. This is to ensure that you have sufficient time to finish the minimum requirements and also have extra time to implement additional functions for your system. Read the papers suggested by your supervisor, because they can give you ideas on how to implement your system in a better or different way. Strive hard to produce a complete system that meets all the requirements. Trust your group mates. Working in a group is usually better than working as an individual. Each person in a group can complement the others. For more information about this project, see the project poster. Camera Based Interactive Wall Display With Hand Detection Using LED Lights 2009-2010, MA1: Sit Chu Wah, Sin Kwok San and Luk Tsan Kwong This system allows people doing a presentation using a standard PC connected to a projector to conveniently control the operating system without using a mouse or keyboard. No expensive equipment is required, only a single web camera to detect the hand movements and three LED lights worn on the fingers of one hand to help the system to detect the hand's location and gestures. Luk Tsan Kwong said their project was a success because they were willing to try different methods and do suitable experiments to achieve a better solution. Guidance and teamwork were also very important. The group had 18 formal meetings from June to March, and almost all were with Professor Mak. Meetings provided opportunities for brainstorming and gaining insight from an expert. The group seemed to have the right synergy, and each member had important tasks to complete individually. Luk Tsan Kwong said that he personally spent 50 hours studying different books and APIs related to the project and about 70 hours doing coding and testing. For future FYP groups, Luk Tsan Kwong said that it is a must that students take related courses for the FYP and study different examples and books. For more information about this project, see the presentation video or the project poster. Room Level Indoor Localization 2008-2009, QIAN2: Samuel Yam, Kenny Tsang and Ben Fan Room-level location estimation requires a wireless network composed of active electronic devices called nodes that are capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding information over a communications channel. The network must contain three or more reference nodes (nodes located in static locations) and one or more blind nodes (nodes that can move and whose position is unknown but can be calculated with a location algorithm). 99% accuracy was achieved in this project based on careful gathering of RSSI data and a sophisticated algorithm. Samuel Yam said: "I think that the most important element of the FYP is the value of the FYP topic. Different FYPs focus on different values. Let me give some examples: Commerce projects must focus on business value. Game projects must focus on game graphics. Stocktaking projects must focus on speed. New product projects must focus on some new feature. Our FYP was about localization, so the value was accuracy. "Finally, our project was almost 100% accurate, even in extreme cases in our demonstration, so our project was a success. My advice is to decide upon the value for your FYP. Find the most suitable value that your project should focus on and execute it perfectly. "As for the time spent on our project, if you only count research, coding and reporting, I would say that it only took us about 200 hours. However, if you include all the time spent thinking of ideas and thinking about how to do the project, the total time spent was triple." For more information about this project, see the project poster. Designing Freeform Models with 3D Curves 2008-2009, TA3: Yin Hengli and Liu He This project was a sketch-based modeling system based on FiberMesh. It provided a user-friendly interface that allowed users to draw 3D models by interactively adding or changing the control curves which defined the shape of the model. Users could also change control curves to modify the model geometry. The system achieved most of the functionalities of FiberMesh, including surface construction, control curve creation, surface deformation, cut, extrusion, curve erasing and curve type changing. The group also developed a new surface construction algorithm. Yin Hengli said: "I don't think that what we did made our project a success as much as the innovative idea from FiberMesh that made it successful. When we went to Kunming for the competition in June, the teachers and students were not interested in how we implemented it, but the innovative idea of 3D modeling. We spent about a semester to finish it, because we did spend time to find some new algorithms. If we had simply implemented it using their algorithms, it might not have taken this long. For future FYP groups, my advice is that it is important to spend time to study the algorithms at the very beginning." For more information about this project, see the project poster. FYP Winner Selection Evaluation criteria: - Technical quality - Suitable for external competition - Good demonstration - Other considerations At least one student in each winning project received an A grade (90% or above). Not all students in each group necessarily received A due to differentiation by supervisors. Some students in other projects might have received A due to their achievements, but their projects were not selected, since they fell short in at least one of the three criteria used.

FYP Reports Every FYP group is required to submit three reports: a proposal (due in September), a progress report (due in February) and a final report (due in April). The structure of these reports is almost the same. The proposal is the basis for the progress report, which is the basis for the final report. The CTs can help with all three reports, although they primarily help with the proposal and progress report after these reports are already submitted. FYP Report and Presentation Examples FYP project topics typically follow FYP advisors' research areas of interest. Some FYP advisors have given permission to view some examples of good FYP final reports via this website. Since FYP oral presentations typically include MS PowerPoint presentations that follow the same structure as the final reports, watching videos of previous FYP oral presentations can also be helpful. Thus, some examples of good FYP oral presentations have been collected and uploaded to YouTube. The reports and presentations have been categorized according to research area, and links are provided below.

Between October and January to discuss your submitted proposal, focusing mainly on the introduction. 2. Between February and April to discuss your submitted progress report, focusing mainly on the methodology section. Optional CT Meetings You can also meet with your CT during any of the following times if you want: • In August or September to discuss your proposal draft. • In February to discuss your progress report draft. • In April to discuss your final report draft. • In April or May to discuss and/or practice your presentation.

The team consists of PG students and postdoctoral fellows Dou Shen, Rong Pan, Jiantao Sun, Junfeng Pan, Kangheng Wu and Jie Yin, and their supervisor Prof. Yang Qiang, a faculty member of the Department of Computer Science at HKUST. The ACM KDDCUP is the most rigorous annual competition in the field of machine learning and data mining. The competition is open to all academic institutes, industries as well as individuals from around the world. Since its inception in 1997, the KDDCUP competition has presented some very practical and challenging data mining problems. Many more researchers and practitioners participate in the contest over the years, and the KDDCUP datasets have become benchmarks for the data mining field. ACM KDDCUP Contest 2005 was held between May and July 2005 by the ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining which was aimed at solving a difficult and practical problem in Internet search, for the classification of 800,000 realistic Internet search queries. A good solution to this problem will help improve the current internet search and information retrieval technology. Many teams around the world completed event and 37 solutions were submitted. Solutions include the design and implementation of algorithms based on artificial intelligence, statistics, database and information retrieval technologies. This year's tasks are particularly challenging due to the large size of the search problem and the lack of training data that are usually given in data mining problems. The HKUST team used an ensemble based search method that applies machine learning algorithms innovatively. They won all three prizes set up by the KDDCUP organizers, including the "Query Categorization Precision Award", "Query Categorization Performance Award", and the "Query Categorization Creativity Award". An award ceremony was held on August 21, 2005 in Chicago, USA. See 2005 ACM KDDCUP Official Web Site for more information.

With the purpose of motivating undergraduate and postgraduate students all over Hong Kong and Macau to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and ideas to tackle real life problems, the Cup's competition has been fierce from the very beginning. A Call for Participants invitation has been sent out back in early October to all universities in these two cities, encouraging students to challenge themselves on "big ideas of AI" by using latest cool AI technologies to change the world, with technical support provided by MSRA. Fourteen proposals were received from seven universities, from which the academic reviewing panel has selected nine teams that can enter the final round. Dr. Tieyan Liu of MSRA kicked off the finale by giving a talk on challenges and Opportunities in Deep Learning. After which the event was unveiled by the officiating hosts Prof. Tim Cheng, Dean of School of Engineering (SENG), and Prof. Qiang Yang, Head of Department of Computer Science and Engineering cum Director of BDI, HKUST. Prof. Tim CHENG, Dean of Engineering Prof. Cheng welcomed the teams from different universities and thanked MSRA for its long term support and collaborations with HKUST. "This competition is particularly meaningful, thank you all for taking the initiatives to take part. AI is a very fascinating and hot topic these days in our society. Everyone is pushing for innovation, and any innovation is created for a purpose, that is what we engineers are always adhered to. Being in the research fields for more than 30 years, I always emphasize three important grounds of every research, first it must be interesting, then it must be novel, and finally it better be useful and has its application. All teams are here to show us your innovative ideas, I hope you have enjoyed going through these research and creative stages in this competition. No matter what the final result is, it is the process that is more important," he said. "Please enjoy working in this topic in the spotlight. While you may find life not so hard when working in popular topics like AI, do always remember that quality is more important than how fancy the topic is, because eventually in the downturn of all popular topics, which are meant to go through its ups and downs cycle, it is the strongest ones who are going to stay." Prof. Qiang YANG, Head of CSE Department "Indeed there has been tremendous interest in the area of AI and big data, that is why the Big Data Institute has been formed a year ago," seconded Prof. Yang at his opening speech following Prof. Cheng's. "That is a joint initiative that glues together different departments such as us, the Computer Science and Engineering, Mathematics, Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, and Business School under the same umbrella. We want to apply the knowledge to other domains and enhance its impact to eventually benefit a much wider audience across industries." He further introduced some of the major projects undergoing in BDI at present, including the WeChat-HKUST joint AI Laboratory, Smart City projects that examines how crucial transport issues faced by metropolis can be tackled and studies how to improve people's livelihood by creating a people-aware city framework. Also there is a new MSc course on Big Data Technology that has overwhelming 600 plus applications received and eventually admitted less than 100 students. "And there are more to come under BDI in time," added Prof. Yang. "All these growing impacts lie on the crucial support from our industry partners, such as our long term collaborator MSRA. We have many students working there, many others starting their own companies with MSRA's support, etc. I myself was the first visiting scholar at MSRA too. Our interwoven relationship would surely strengthen further and we are keen to see more initiatives such as this HKUST-MSRA Cup in the future." Prof. Lei Chen, who organized the Cup with MSRA, then kicked off the final presentation rounds by inviting the first team from University of Hong Kong. Each of the nine final teams was given 20 minutes to present their ideas at the competition ground, ranging from 3D printing, emotion tracking tool, intelligent entertainment, smart home, language detector, intelligent note taker, among other AI topics. The judging panel was amazed by the creativity of all the teams and had a difficult time selecting the winner. Eventually HKUST University's team composed of Mr. Long Ting Pang and Ho King Tsan Wong took the champion out of all the outstanding teams with their project on "Foodology". The team composed of HKU and CUHK students won the second place with their project "Noted - the Intelligent Note Taker". The third place went to another HKUST team with their project "NetworkUP". The team from Macau won "the most innovated award". An award and mingling dinner was then held at HKUST Conference Lodge to announce the results and everyone enjoyed the evening sharing their insights on AI applications with one another. During the dinner, Dr. Winnie Cui, the UR manager of MSRA, praised the HKUST for organizing such a wonderful event and thanked the support from SENG and BDI. She wished the collaboration between HKUST and MSRA will lead to more fruitful and impactful results in the near future. Prof. Tim Cheng, Dean of the Engineering, gave his thanks to the support from MSRA once again and encouraged students to participate more in these events in the future and keep in mind about insisting his/her dream during their careers.

TITLE: Integrated Feng Shui System
https://www.cse.ust.hk/feng_shui/
DATE: Mon, 29 Dec 2008 04:27:58 GMT, 13600
Home Screen Shots Downloads Contact us What is this? This project is the Final Year Project of Department of Computer Science and Engineering in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. This is supervised by Professor David Rossiter in 2006 - 2007 and one of the Best Final Year Projects at that year. Besides, it wins the First Runner-Up and Bronze Award in Hong Kong Region and Final Round in Gui Zhou, China of 2007 Amway Pan-Pearl River Delta Region Universities IT Projects Competition respectively. The purpose of this project is to analyze the Feng Shui of a flat and the surrounding. Flat design is presented through a 2D display. The system will give appropriate recommendations on how to best arrange the flat for most efficient feng shui. Finally, the system will generate a 3D environment for the user to view his/her ideal flat. What is Feng Shui? Feng Shui is the ancient Chinese traditional art of placement based upon a philosophy of the movement of “Chi” or nature energy through our environments. It has a long history and shows us how to support the flow of energy in our lives to augment health and prosperity. It is indeed a combination of environmental study and orientation study aimed to harmonize the energies of the universe with the human race. Feng Shui is an abstract and difficult theory for most people. We have developed software that can reveal the Feng Shui theory in a more concrete and easier way. With the system, anyone who is not familiar with Feng Shui should now be able to understand this traditional Chinese art more and create his/her ideal flat. Scope In fact, in Feng Shui profession, there are lots of factions with different kinds of Feng Shui principles. It is necessary for us to choose one of them to follow. The system implements most of the Feng Shui rules. The major rules such as “Earth Luck”, “Eight Mansions”, “Flying Star” together with 55 other sub-rules are included. There are three types of recommendations given by the system. They are swapping the usage of rooms, adding some Feng Shui objects, and moving the original position of furniture inside the flat. The system is so flexible that the user is able to choose to or not to accept any recommendations so that they can build their desired floor plan. The final Feng Shui report allows the user to know more about their flat’s Feng Shui status and some brief explanations of the Feng Shui rules. The user is able to view the 3D environment as if he/she was personally inside his/her drawn floor plan.

All of this information is essential to the Feng Shui analysis of the system. [back to top] 3. Floor Plan Drawing The user is allowed to draw their desired flat freely in the system’s floor plan drawing panel. This can be done by choosing the suitable components on the left hand side’s tool box kit and then placing them at the desired position on the panel. Click to open image at normal size [back to top] 4. Feng Shui Analysis and Recommendations - Room Swapping Click to open image at normal size In the first recommendation section, the user is asked to input their preferred Feng Shui recommendation priorities. There are 6 priorities in total. They are “Good at Health”, “Good at Relationship with others”, “Good at Harmonious Family”, “Good at Wealth”, “Good at Pickings” and “Good at Producing Offspring”. The user can prioritize them from the most important one to the least important one by putting them in the right sequence in the form. Click to open image at normal size Once the priority is confirmed, the system will perform the first Feng Shui analysis. This analysis is based on the Eight Mansions rules only. Then, the system will give the respective recommendations and explanations and tell the user how different rooms should be swapped based on the priority set before. There will be a section showing the marks of current Feng Shui state and the marks after taking our recommendation on room swapping so as to let the user compare the two Feng Shui states. The marks include health, wealth, career, family relationship and interpersonal relationship. A recommended floor plan will then be shown and the user can choose to or not to accept it. [back to top] 5. Outdoor Setting Click to open image at normal size For each view of main entrance and windows of the user’s flat, the user is asked to select from the right hand side’s list box the objects they can view from that main entrance or window. The user also needs to set in each view the approximate distance of each object. [back to top] 6. Furniture Allocation Click to open image at normal size Different kinds of furniture can be selected from on the tool box kit. They are categorized with different sub-headings. After selecting the desired furniture, the user can freely place it on the floor plan drawing panel at any position. [back to top] 7. Feng Shui Analysis and Recommendation - Placing Feng Shui Object and Moving Furniture Positions Click to open image at normal size Click to open image at normal size In this section, there will be a form popped up showing all the matched rules and guiding the user step-by-step on how to place different Feng Shui objects for each rule matched. For each matched rule, there will be a highlighted area on the floor plan telling the user which part of the flat is related to that rule. All the matched rules will be shown on a tree list in the form and categorized according to the rule’s related part of the flat. The user is allowed to select the rule they want to view freely from the list. The user can choose to follow the recommendations or ignore them. There are two types of solutions the system provides. The first type is to place the Feng Shui objects for the user automatically at the suitable places while the second type is to move the related furniture to the right place. Whenever there is any flow of ‘Chi’ for the current selected rule, they are shown as some arrows representing the strength and the direction of the ‘Chi’. [back to top] 8.

These recorded activities include phone calls, uses of Apps on smartphones, and expression of opinions over social-network objects such as photos. These activities and actions give rise to a huge amount of data. Activity recognition aims to understand users' actions and intentions based on models built from these data. Accurate activity recognition allows us to track people's daily activities, to recognize the semantic functions of places, to help users and managers identify spammers in an online social network, and to predict the future activity levels of social-network users. In this thesis, we study a special kind of activity recognition problems in which a social network structure is available or abundant social activity records are given as external knowledge sources. We call these two kinds of auxiliary knowledge sources as social knowledge. Utilizing them has two unique challenges. First, how to utilize the rich knowledge in the social structure and model it for the activity recognition model for each user in the social network. Second, while the data is abundant in general, sometimes the labeled data is limited due to reasons such as short usage time and inactiveness of some users and high cost to label data in both physical and virtual worlds. Transfer learning is a new learning framework that is suitable to model external knowledge sources and becomes especially effective when the target problem domain suffers from data sparsity issues. In the past decade, transfer learning has been successfully applied to application domains such as text mining, image understanding, and recommender systems. We propose a novel transfer learning framework that uses auxiliary social knowledge to improve activity recognition tasks, and apply it to four specific problems: social spammer detection, semantic place prediction, social activity level prediction, and heterogeneous transfer from online social activities to the physical world. Our experimental results on the four specific recognition tasks all demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework.

The project was supervised by Prof Jogesh MUPPALA. There are hundreds of places in Hong Kong with names which are difficult for foreigners to pronounce. Foreigners often have trouble communicating with local citizens when they go to various places. The project is an Android app which allows users to select the text language: English, Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese. When users tap on a location on the Google maps of Hong Kong, the system displays the address name in the three languages. The users can choose to hear the pronunciation in English, Cantonese or Putonghua. The system utilizes a built in Android text-to-speech (TTS) engine for English, an open source TTS engine for Putonghua, and a custom-made TTS engine for Cantonese. The system is also linked to a tourism information website "Expat / Tourist Sharing Board" which was also created by the team. The award presentation ceremony was held on 3 April 2012 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. The project was displayed at the HKICTA Winners Pavilion at International ICT Expo 2012 during 13-16 April 2012 at the Center.

The ACM KDD CUP is the most rigorous annual competition in the field of predictive technology and data mining. The competition is opened to all industries and hundreds of individuals from around the world participated. ACM KDD CUP Contest 2004 was held between May and July 2004 by the ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The contest consisted of 59 teams worldwide solving a difficult and practical problem in data mining from biological databases, for knowledge discovery that is of interest to biologists. HKUST's Professor Qiang Yang is the coach of the team. The Association for Computing Machinery's Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (ACM SIGKDD) officially presented the team with the award on 24 Aug 2004 at the ACM KDD 2004 Conference in Seattle, Washington, USA. This success marked a major milestone for the newly established HKUST-CAS joint lab, which aims to promote joint research between researchers from Hong Kong UST and Chinese Academy of Sciences on topics ranging from data mining and multimedia to sensor networks. Data mining is a multi-disciplinary research and application area that aims to discover novel and useful knowledge from vast databases, using methods ranging from artificial intelligence, statistics and databases. This year's KDD CUP focused on finding patterns from a large biological dataset. The competition consists of two phases. The first phase lasted for over a month in which a training dataset is provided for constructing a predictive model. In the second phase the test data are provided and the predicted results are submitted. The final results are judged by an independent panel on a number of success criteria. This year's competition focuses on data-mining for a variety of performance criteria such as Accuracy, Squared Error, Cross Entropy, and ROC Area. The joint team won number one in two of the criteria and tied on overall scores of all criteria, with two other teams from New Zealand and USA, respectively. Result of the event is available on ACM KDD CUP 2004 - Results.

TITLE: Code Analysis, Testing and Learning | HKUST CSE
https://www.cse.ust.hk/pg/research/projects/scc/castle/
DATE: Thu, 07 May 2020 14:11:14 GMT, 4036
More about HKUST University News Academic Departments A-Z Life@HKUST Library Map & Directions Jobs@HKUST Faculty Profiles About HKUST Intranet School of Engineering Quick Links for Undergraduates Postgraduates Faculty & Staff Alumni Job Seekers Employers & Industry Partners About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements School of Engineering Code Analysis, Testing and Learning What are code analysis, testing and learning? While they seem to be jargons to many, the related technologies are making impacts on how software changes the world. In highly competitive software markets, companies need to ship reliable software products that their clients can trust. As such, software quality is one of their top concerns. What if you are told that a bot will learn your program and write tests for you? What if you are further told that the bot will learn from test execution results and locate where the faults in your program reside? What if the bot can even fix the faults for you when you are crossing your fingers? CASTLE is research team led by Prof Shing-Chi Cheung to study the state-of-the-arts technologies on code analysis, testing and learning. Besides pursuing the advancement in automated test generation, fault localization and program repair, CASTLE is solving the challenging problem of automated program synthesis. Techniques developed are supported by tools that can be applied by users on their software applications. The following are the overviews of two CASTLE research projects that automatically locate program faults for enterprise and mobile applications by blending state-of-the-arts software engineering, big data and artificial intelligence technologies. Locating Crash-inducing Changes Software crashes are severe manifestation of software bugs that result in poor user experiences. To facilitate the diagnosis of crashing bugs, crash reporting systems (e.g., Microsoft Windows Error Reporting) have been deployed to collect crash reports automatically. Nevertheless, developers still require much manual effort in debugging crashes. Although there are many crash analysis techniques proposed to help diagnose crashes, we still have very limited understanding on existing crash diagnosis practice. CASTLE found that crash-inducing changes are one critical piece of debugging information and thereby proposed efficient techniques with support tools to automatically locate crash-inducing changes. Upon crash diagnosis, developers can integrate these tools into existing crash reporting systems, such as Microsoft Crash Reporting. The tools can be incorporated into products, deploying a crash reporting system. Taming Android Fragmentation Android ecosystem is heavily fragmented. The numerous combinations of different device models and operating system versions make it difficult for Android app developers to assure the compatibility of their software across these models and system versions. CASTLE developed analysis techniques and support tools to automatically mine and detect Android compatibility issues. The tools report actionable debugging information when it detects potential issues. Android app developers can deploy the tools to their code and detect potential incompatibility issues that may arise across device models and system versions. For each reported issue, app developers may validate the issue by running their app on the concerned device models or system versions. Android device vendors may also follow the methodology to address compatibility problems in their products arising from the fragmentation in their OS releases, library versions and hardware configurations.

Dik Lun LEE 李迪麟 (PhD, Toronto, 1985) Professor Professor in the Department of Computer Science. Before joining HKUST, I was an Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science at the Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio, USA). In 1992, I spent my sabbatical leave as a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC, Dublin, Ohio, USA) and as a consultant to Information Dimensions Incorporated (IDI, Dublin, Ohio, USA), which was acquired by Opentext. Please explore further my background and other duties. I served as a guest editor for several special issues on database-related topics, and as program committee member and chair for several international conferences. As an ACM Lecturer from 1991 to 1993, I had given seminars on document access methods at universities and ACM Chapters. From 1995 to 1998, I served as an executive committee member, Vice Chairman and Chairman of ACM Hong Kong Chapter. "If you took all of the gold in the world it would roughly make a cube 67 feet on a side. So if you took all the gold in the world, we could have a cube that went down there 67 feet ... 67 feet high ... it would be worth at today's market prices about $7 trillion [Note: In 4/2011, gold price was at around US$1530/ounce]. ... Now, for $7 trillion ... you could have all the farmland in the United States, you could have about seven Exxon Mobil [Note: One of the largest publicly traded companies in the world], and you could have $1 trillion of walking around money. ... I, you know, maybe call me crazy but I'll take the farmland and the Exxon Mobil." Warren Buffett, CNBC Interview, Apr 30, 2011 "The contributions we made to computer science were unintended consequences." Bill Buxton, 2010. "We think the sun has not set on even the first day of the search opportunity." Yusuf Mehdi, MSN chief, Microsoft, Apr 2004. "The truth about knowledge management is that the quality of knowledge always matters less than the quality of management." --- Michael Schrage, MIT Media Lab "Most of the students' contribution to the creative diversity of the [MIT's Media] laboratory comes out in their search for a thesis topic, when they fit their own skills, perspectives, and interests to the interests and perspecive of both the faculty and sponsor." --- K. Haase, Chief Scientist, MIT Media Lab, in "Why the Media Lab works - A personal view," IBM Systems Journal, Vol 39, Nos 3/4, 2000. [Emphasis added by me.] "[At Xerox PARC ...] only 35 people costing in today's dollars, 10 or so million dollars, were enough to create trillions of dollars of wealth. Every large company has more than enough to afford PARC." --- Alan Kay in Still Waiting for the Revolution. "That is, thinking of the current uses of computers and communications as objects on a landscape, the "interesting stuff" is in the spaces between (and relating to) the objects." --- W.A.

The forum featured top Hong Kong security IT professionals, many are CSE Alumni, who were joined by Prof. Qiang Yang, the CSE department head, Prof. Tim Cheng, the Dean of Engineering School, and Mr. Charles Mok, Legco Member of IT, as well as by members of the Cybersecurity Laboratory, and other CSE faculties and students. The event is opened by Prof. Yang's remark on the motivation of starting the cybersecurity lab as a result of insufficient attention to cybersecurity in Hong Kong institutions. Cybersecurity lab is the first major laboratory in Hong Kong universities dedicated to all major issues of security. Prof. Cheng expressed his unquestioned support to cybersecurity research from the engineering school standpoint. And Mr. Mok acknowledged that Hong Kong government should bring more attention and support to cybersecurity research in Hong Kong and he would be willing to play a more active role in bridging government planning and security research. Following these opening remarks and short introductions by faculty members, professionals from Hong Kong security industry shared many interesting problems and solutions from their daily challenges in fighting security threats. The audience enjoyed the talks by experts from local industries such as CISCO, Tencent, Cathay Pacific, HKITF, Knownsec and NTT Security. The forum was concluded by panel discussions on how young students can follow their passion and become security professionals. The Security Day also featured the official formation of the CSE Firebird CTF (Capture-The-Flag) team. The forum was hosted by Prof. Charles Zhang, director of the Cybersecurity Laboratory.

The competition is amongst the best Final Year Projects in the School of Engineering at HKUST. The award-winning project is "Application of image processing techniques to tissue texture analysis and image compression", under supervision of Prof. Albert Chung of the Department. This project is considered to be the first semi-automatic software for cirrhosis check in Hong Kong, and the accurracy is up to 80%. It is planned that the technology will have a clinical test at Whales Hospital. "It is so exciting that we could win the champion of this competition. I think the project itself is meaningful, which could contribute to the clinical aspect. I wish to thank our advisor, Prof. Albert Chung, and our clinical consultant, Dr.Simon Yu (Radiologist from the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong), for their support and advise in this project.", the winners said. According to World Health Organization (WHO), cirrhosis causes hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Nowadays, cirrhosis detection mainly relies on manual analysis of ultrasonic liver images and histological analysis of patients' liver samples. Detection results are highly dependent on the experience and ability of sonographers to observe certain confusing textural characteristics. Histological analysis is more accurate, but it is invasive and involves complicated processes which require much more time and resources. "Severity information plays an essential role in the cirrhosis medical treatment. In this project, we aim to provide a semi-automatic three severity levels cirrhosis classification system. Ultrasound scanning machine calibration and machine dependent parameters are not required by our system. Without machine dependent measurement, this classification system is able to deliver classification result quickly after basic training procedure. With the aid of this system, patients will be able to obtain preliminary diagnostic results within several minutes once ultrasonic liver scan is available", Mr. Law said. Ten-fold Stratified Cross-validation is performed for accuracy testing. It is proved that the system can provide up to 81% accuracy for classification of "with-or-without cirrhosis", and 71% accuracy for classification of "no, early or advanced cirrhosis". The project has been reported in Ming Pao on 20 June, 2004 Ming Pao on 29 June, 2004 Oriental Daily on 20 June, 2004 More News Navigation Navigation About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements Last updated on 2004-07-02 Privacy Sitemap Copyright © The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The committee's decision to single out this article was explained as follows: The article contributes an innovative approach to recommender systems. Its main contribution is an extension of two existing methods on integrating heterogeneous data (user feedback) in a collaborative recommendation system. Using transfer learning, the authors' extension addresses the issue of uncertainty. This process is iterative: (1) maps learned recommendation (built using labeled data) to unlabeled data, and (2) identifies items that are likely going to be highly reviewed to get further input. Because recommender systems are an important topic in HCI, and this paper introduces a sensible and broadly applicable technique to a wide class of interactive machine learning systems, it makes an important contribution to the field of intelligent interactive systems.

What is the application timeline? I did not get the offer in the early recruiting phase, could I still submit application in regular phase? How good do I need to be to be accepted as a MPhil student? Whom should I ask to write my letters of recommendation? Will I receive a studentship from the department to support my studies? Can I apply for part-time studies? I am not from Hong Kong. Can I still apply for a PG program in your department? Can I apply for a studentship from your department? Do I need to take the TOEFL exam? After submitting an application, should I contact individual faculty members? How can I find the research interest of the faculty members? Where can I get further information about PG studies? Q1. How to apply? Please refer to the Application Procedure in the Office of Postgraduate Studies (PGSO) Website. Q2. What is the application timeline? Please refer to the Admissions Timeline in the PGSO Website. Applications will be processed on a continuous basis as they arrive until positions are filled. You are thus recommended to apply as soon as possible. Q3. I did not get the offer in the early recruiting phase, could I still submit application in regular phase? Yes, you can still apply in the regular phase because the 2 phases are independent, and we reserve a number of quotas for the regular phase. Q4. How good do I need to be to be accepted as a MPhil student? There are no hard-and-fast rules for admission to the MPhil program. We rank applicants based on our judgment of their background and general ability to do a research thesis. In practice this usually means that the two most important criteria are your CGA and your letters of recommendation. Good letters of recommendation are essential. A letter from a faculty member that states he/she is willing to be your research supervisor is even better (but uncommon); one that states that she/he is willing to supervise you AND fund your studentship directly out of his/her research grants is even better (but even rarer). We want to emphasize that the CGA is not everything. An applicant with a very strong letter of recommendation might be admitted over one with a slightly higher CGA but weaker letters. In the past most students with B+/A- CGA or above (the exact CGA varied from year to year) and good letters were accepted. The exact number of students accepted depends upon many factors including number of studentships available to the department and a forecast of the number of students expected to graduate that year. Q5. Whom should I ask to write my two letters of recommendation? The letters of recommendation are used to judge your ability and fitness to be a MPhil student so you should ask someone who knows you well enough to write something substantial about you, including your creativity, intelligence and ability to do research. Your FYP advisor is a good choice. Another possibility is the instructor of any course that you did very well in (a useful `trick' is to find a course that you really enjoy and are doing well in and make sure that the instructor knows who you are as a person, not just as a name and number on assignments. One way of doing this is by asking good questions in class. Another is to go to the instructor after class and ask for extra reading material and then discuss it with him/her. Who knows; you might even find an advisor this way. Finally, if you have worked outside UST, especially in an IT related job, you can ask your supervisor for a letter. Q6. Will I receive a studentship from the department to support my studies? The current university guideline is that all full-time research PG students should be funded 12 months a year. The studentship support can come from the supervisor, the department, the school, and/or the university, and can be in the form of Fellowship, Teaching Assistantship or Research Assistantship. The support may be dependent on satisfactory progress in the PG study or satisfactory work. Q7. Can I apply for part-time studies? We normally prefer to accept applicants who are applying for full time studies. Only in special cases as described below, will we accept part-time applicants. For applicants to the MPhil and PhD program the applicant must already have found a faculty member who has agreed to be the applicant's thesis supervisor. Q8. I am not from Hong Kong. Can I still apply for a PG program in your department? Can I apply for a studentship from your department? Anyone, no matter where they are from, can apply to our department. HKUST will consider the suitability of candidates to receive the PGS while reviewing their application for research postgraduate programs. Q9. Do I need to take the TOEFL exam? As a general rule we require that all non-local students must take the TOEFL exam. The only exceptions to this rule are students who received their undergraduate degree in an English speaking institute. Q10. After submitting an application, should I contact individual faculty members? Yes, you are encouraged to contact faculty members whom you are interested in working with. However, mass emails to the faculty are unlikely to be effective (they receive many such emails). If you would like to contact individual faculty members, please try to differentiate your email from hundreds of others: Why are you interested in his/her research? What qualities of yours make you a good student of his/hers? If you have read one of his/her papers, do you have some comments and further ideas? Q11. How can I find the research interest of the faculty members? You may refer to our faculty page for individual faculty members' research and contact information. You may also refer to our research areas and the affiliated labs and centers to discover more. Q12. Where can I get further information about PG studies?

TITLE: BSc in Computer Science (COSC) | HKUST CSE

DATE: Sat, 10 Aug 2019 19:45:15 GMT, 21654
B.Sc. in Computer Science, HKUST A special undergraduate program tailored for double-major students Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Browser does not support iframes. Unable to display image. A 7-gigapixel panorama of HKUST. Hong Kong, June 2010. Sidebar Menu General Information Admission Study Plan FAQ Contact External Shortcuts ARR Useful Info Curriculum Handbook Programs and Courses Courses/COMP Courses/MATH Courses/PHYS Study Plan Sheet (4-yr) Program/BSc in CS (4-yr) Entered in 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 CSE Dept Home General Information The Computer Science and Engineering Department offers a BSc in Computer Science (COSC) program in addition to its existing BEng in Computer Science (COMP). This special program, however, is not intended for students to take it by itself. It is designed for students who wish to graduate with a double-major degree, i.e., when enrolling in this program in Computer Science, students are also required to declare study in another major. They are then required to complete the requirements of both majors, and will receive a degree with two program designations upon graduation. Students who join the program are carefully supervised in order to build and follow a study plan tailored to their specific interests and needs, and serve as a strong platform to achieve their future career goals. Many alumni subsequently joined top graduate level programs worldwide (see alumni stories at the end of the video). Admission Eligibility Admission to the COSC double-major program requires the permission of both the CSE department and the 2nd department. We currently expect a CGA of A- or higher at the time of the application and the existence of a workable double-major study plan that allows the student to finish within the standard 4 years. In very special cases we will accept students who have a slightly lower average but have shown exceptional performance in their major courses. "Trying out" the program Students who are interested in the possibility of declaring a COSC double-major, should try to develop a tentative study plan to better assess the feasibility of completing the program. This process can be done even before the student declares or is assigned a department during the first year. Please see this Study Plan Sheet for detailed requirements. Officially joining the program Students who have already registered in the BEng in Computer Science (or other undergraduate programs) and wish to study the BSc in Computer Science as their first major must apply for transfer into this program. They are required to declare study in another BSc program (second major) at the same time. Transfer applications should be submitted no earlier than the first regular term of their second year of study and at the latest before the end of the add/drop period in the first regular term of their final year of study. Note that this transfer can only be officially completed after the student is assigned a department. However, the student can discuss their study plan with the coordinator in advance of declaring a department to ensure that they will be able to join the COSC double-major. Declaration procedure for COMP BEng students: Fill in two forms at the same time: (1) the Application for Program Transfer form to transfer from BEng program (e.g., COMP/CSIE/CPEG) to BSc program (COSC), (2) the Declaration of Additional Undergraduate Major Program form to declare a dual program designation (e.g., MATH). Please note that MATH requires students to declare which major option (e.g., Applied Math, Pure Math) they wish to pursue at the time of declaring MATH as the second major. The forms can be submitted to COSC coordinator (via the CSE General Office) any time during a semester, however the transfer will only be effective at the beginning of the following semester. Students who wish to study the BSc in Computer Science as their second major should follow the declaration procedures set by their (first) major department. Leaving the program Students who wish to discontinue study in the BSc in Computer Science as their first major may apply for transferring to the BEng program in Computer Science or other program. Application for the former must be submitted to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering no later than the last day of the add/drop period in the first semester of their final year of study. Application for the latter will be considered and approved by the program department concerned. Study Plan Important Resources This section provides information on preparing a study plan and filling out a Study Plan Sheet that meets the requirements of the COSC degree. Current detailed information on program requirements on all majors for first year students can be found in the Program Catalog. For students admitted in earlier years, this information is in the Curriculum Handbook. Direct links to the COSC program information is provided on the menu bar to the left. Note that students also need to fulfill the requirements of the second major. Make sure to also check these requirements in the program catalog or curriculum handbook. Refer to the external shortcuts on the left sidebar at the top of the page for direct links to other useful resources, such as course listings. School, University, and Language requirements School course requirements only need to be fulfilled for the first major. School requirements for the additional majors do not need to be fulfilled unless they are a prerequisite to a required course of one of the majors. University course requirements are common and can double-count for both majors. Students only need to fulfill language requirements of one major. They need to officially request a substituation for the other major's language requirement at the general office of the other major. Usually students are expected to follow the language requirements of the first major, however there are situations where it may be suitable to take language courses from the other major. For example, the language course in the final year of the COSC major is tied with the FYP project. So, if a student is not doing an FYP project, it would make sense to take the language course of the other major even if COSC is their first major. Notes for students interested in going out on exchange HKUST students are highly encoraged to go on exchange. The international exposure gained enhances students' educational experience, boosts personal development, and helps provide a competitive advantage in future career development. The majority of our COSC students do exchange out for a semester. Doing an exchange is possible, though care must be taken to develop a study plan to accommodate, taking courses that can be transfered to HKUST to fill degree requirements. Notes for students interested in doing research Students interested in doing research are encouraged to approach a faculty member with similar research interests and discuss the possibility of working on a UROP project. UROP stands for Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and is one of HKUST's signature programs designed to provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to engage in academic research and help them develop a broad and insightful perspective of their areas of interest. For additional information on this program refer to the UROP project page. As with the exchange program, care must be taken not to overload oneself with too many courses and research tasks in the same term. FAQ What are the major differences between the BEng (COMP) degree and the BSc (COSC) degree? The BSc degree retains all of the core COMP BEng requirements. The major differences are that Final Year project and industrial training requirements have been removed and the choice of required COMP courses is more flexible. This allows strong students to have the flexiblity to take more advanced courses, get a double-major with other fields, and have more time for UROP or other research opportunities. What other majors can be taken as a second major with COSC? Any other major with the exception of COMP and CPEG could, theoretically, be taken as a second major with COSC. In practice, scheduling constraints make some 2nd major pairings impossible. Known workable pairings are COSC/MATH (for all MATH programs), COSC/PHYSICS, COSC/MAEC and COSC/RMBI. This does not mean that other pairings are impossible. In fact, the COSC double-major was originally only designed with the MATH pairing in mind. Later combinations were added when interested students came to the CSE department and asked if it was possible to set up a study plan allowing other possibilities. If you are interested in a pairing that is not listed above, please contact the COSC coordinator. I don't know now if I want to double-major but do want to keep my options open for declaring later. What should I do? The first thing you should do is take the courses that would be necessary for double-major students. For COSC, that requires taking COMP 1021/2 as early as possible. For MATH, that would require taking MATH 2021 or MATH 2023. If you are all interested in the possibility of declaring a double-major later, it is best for you to talk with the COSC coordinator as early as possible in order to develop a reasonable study plan. How long will it take a student to get a double-major? Usually the same duration as a standard program, though overloading will be required as there is an increase in number of required credits. Can courses double-count towards requirements of both COSC and MATH? Yes. Some MATH courses, such as MATH 2121 and MATH 2421, are required by the COSC degree. Thus these courses count towards fulfilling requirements of both majors. In addition, the COSC 4-yr program requires taking 6 COMP electives. Of these, with prior approval of the COMP UG Coordinator, up to 3 can be satisfied by taking computer science related courses in a non-COMP department. Some courses for which such approval has already been granted are: MATH 3343: Combinatorial Analysis (not regularly offered) MATH 4321: Game Theory (offered in Spring) MATH 4141: Number Theory and Applications (offered in Fall) MATH 3312: Numerical Analysis (offered in Fall) ELEC 2420: Basic Electronics (offered in Fall) Notice that the above list is not exhaustive; other non-CSE courses may also considered upon the approval of the UG director. What are possible course substitutions? Various course substitutions may be allowed by different departments. For example, MATH 3033 can be replaced by MATH 3043, MATH 2721 by MATH 2421 or any MATH 3xxx course. The general principle is that any substitutions allowed by the department XXXX for their normal BSc programs are allowed for the double-major COSC-XXXX program. Please seek approval from the XXXX UG coordinator concerning any substitutions of XXXX courses. What will be the degree awarded for double-major COSC-MATH? Only one degree will be awarded. For example, for students doing COSC+MATH: students whose 1st declared major was COSC will get a BSc in Computer Science & Mathematics. students whose 1st declared major was MATH will get a BSc in Mathematics & Computer Science. How are study patterns and course registration handled? Once enrolled in the double-major, ARR will pre-register all required courses according to the study pattern of COSC-MATH that appears in the Academic Calendar. This means that only the COSC+MATH study pattern is sure to have no time table clashes. You should note, though, note that many double-major students, even COSC+MATH ones, do not follow the normal study pattern (e.g., because they want to go on exchange). In this case, there might also be time clashes. In order to minimize the number of clashes the CSE department does provide some help with registration. In particular, our office staff will contact all registered BSc students prior to semester registration and ask for a list of all required courses (in both majors) that they need to take that semester. We then inform ARR so that are aware of your scheduling issues. This does not guarantee lack of scheduling conflicts but does help minimize them. Do COSC students have to take the FYP? No. Double-major students do not have to register for the final year project course. They may do a final year project or final year thesis if they want to, though. In those cases, the FYP/FYT will count as two COMP electives. Do COSC students have to register for Industrial Experience? No. If a COSC student, does want to take an industrial training module, he/she will need to ask for special permission to register. If you are interested in pursuing this, please ask the COSC coordinator for more information. Can COSC students still minor in other programs? Technically, yes, but this would be difficult and probably require a lot of overloading.

TITLE: Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics on e-Learning Platforms | HKUST CSE

This is one of the major challenges faced by today's e-learning platforms, particularly massive open online course (MOOC) platforms such as Coursera and edX which have students from all over the world. A research team led by Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung, with collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has been developing advanced learning analytics tools to improve online education using machine learning technologies. As a project funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong Government under the HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium, the approach adopted by the team is centered around the notion of personalization. The research mission is to significantly improve the learning effectiveness of e-learning platforms through personalization without having to pare down the massive scale and high learner-to-teacher ratio of the courses. Their personalized e-learning tools monitor the clickstream events of the learners for all the online activities, which include video lecture viewing, discussion forum participation, assignment submission, and quiz/exam performance. Based on the user profiles built and continuously updated, the learning performance of each learner is assessed and predicted with respect to a wide range of performance indicators using ensemble learning and temporal learning models which include recurrent neural network models. The goal is to identify the underperforming learners and their areas of underperformance and to help them improve using two other components of the system, the study plan generator and the AI tutor. Some of the predictive analytics tools that the team members have developed using machine learning techniques for temporal sequence data include predicting the grade distribution at the end of a course, analyzing the effect of each feature of the machine learning model on performance prediction, identifying learners and zooming into each of them to understand why there is a significant drop in the predicted performance within a short period of time, and providing recommendation on additional learning activities to make improvement with respect to various specific performance indicators. Based on similar machine learning techniques for predictive analytics, Prof. Yeung and two of his research team members recently participated in an international educational data mining competition, the 2017 ASSISTments Data Mining Competition. The dataset provided by the competition contains massive data for several hundred students, ranging from the detailed interaction data collected on the popular ASSISTments learning platform when they were middle school students, to career choice data of the students after they graduated from university. The goal was to use the ASSISTments interaction data to predict which students would, a few years later, enter STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) graduate school programs and later STEM careers. Of the 74 teams of researchers participated in the competition, Prof. Yeung's team was awarded the first place. They developed a recurrent neural network model augmented with novel regularizers to address some problems encountered by existing knowledge tracing models to learn semantically meaningful features related to the knowledge states of different mathematical skills. They then made use of these learned features to augment the other static features extracted directly from the ASSISTments interaction data to boost the STEM prediction accuracy.

FYP Progress Report After your CT copy edits the proposal you submit to the FYPMS, you should meet him/her to discuss it. This can be done between October and February. Then, you can go back and edit your proposal document and save it as your progress report. It is not a new report, but rather an update of the proposal. It also becomes the foundation for your final report. The FYP progress report is due in February. Be sure to proofread it and update the verb tenses before you submit it to the FYPMS. 1. Introduction Unless your advisor requested that you radically change your introduction or you changed the scope and aims of your FYP, you probably don't need to rewrite your introduction. Just follow your CT's suggestions to perfect it. 2. Methodology In this section, think of the investigative process that you have gone through; the trial and error. Did you think that Giddy's algorithm should work, but, in testing it, it didn't work? Why didn't it work? What did this [the fact that it didn't work] tell you? How did you apply this knowledge to the next algorithm you chose? This section is important as it shows your team's ability to think analytically and to problem-solve. 2.1 Design Refine and formalize ideas and methods [For example: optic design, data structure design]. 2.2 Implementation Describe in detail three things: The ideas and designs you have FULLY implemented and how and why they differ from what you originally proposed to implement. The ideas and designs you have PARTIALLY implemented and how and why they differ from your original proposal. The ideas and designs you will implement IN THE FUTURE and how and why they differ from your original proposal. Note that the verb tense will vary according to what work is completed. For example: Completed: We used PHP to set up the database. (Past Tense) In-progress: We are using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the UI. (Present Perfect Continuous Tense) Not started yet: We will add the machine learning feature after enough data has been collected. (Future Tense) 2.3 Testing You can update this section by doing the following: Provide a test plan, if possible. Try to be more detailed than you were in the Proposal. Try more and/or bigger data sets, if possible. Think of how you will determine if it is efficient - how will you interpret the results. Think about how can you tell whether your implementation is effective and efficient. 2.4 Evaluation To evaluate your system so far, you can try the following: Find a comparable system. If your system is a multifaceted system, take out one component and compare the results. Think about what else have you achieved in the project so far. Focus on the project, not on yourself: Bad example: We had the opportunity to apply several concepts that we learned from our software engineering course. (This sounds a little like an essay,'My Summer Holiday', rather than a research paper.) Good example: To ensure that our software would operate across platforms, we drew upon three well-established concepts in software engineering: X, Y, and Z. (This gives some good information, telling why something was done.) 3. Project Planning Update the Gantt Chart and the Division of Work, including everything that you have done and will do. 4. Required Hardware and Software Update this section as appropriate, including any new itmes and removing any items that are no longer required. 5. References Update these if necessary. Remember, most CSE advisors like the IEEE citation and reference style. 6. Appendix A - Meeting Minutes More meetings=more minutes Keep your minutes up-to-date. Do them within a day of the meeting. Don't wait until just before the Progress Report is due trying to remember what you said at a meeting five weeks ago. Remember when writing up your minutes that they should cover: tasks done problems and suggested solutions tasks to do, by when, by whom Meetings are a platform for YOU to ask questions. Don't leave technical questions unanswered - it is your job to bring these questions to your supervisor. 7. Appendix B - [Title or Description] Other things that you can find in an appendix: detailed proofs results from experiments illustrations diagrams tables If a table, illustration or diagram is critical for explaining an abstract idea, it may be better to include it in the body of the paper and not in the appendices. Ask your supervisor if you are unsure, but the general rule of thumb is: if it's big and bulky and of little relevance to most readers, put it in an appendix. Future Impact Some employers and grad schools might want to look at your FYP or FYT to see what kind of work you can produce, so this project could affect your future studies or career. Progress Report Format Since your CT will probably want to write on a hard copy of your report, please use double line spacing for the Introduction and Methodology. You can use single spacing for other sections. If you are concerned about the length of the report, see the FYP Advisor Preferences.

The effectiveness of such collaborations depends on the characteristics of the selected devices and the willingness of their owners to help. Thus, mobile applications need to adopt mechanisms that motivate collaboration and compensate those who share their resources. Research has proposed incentive schemes and reputation-based mechanisms designed to operate via centralized authorities. In this thesis, we design and analyze decentralized mechanisms to facilitate the exchange of resources, reputation, and credit, and to maintain a ledger in D2D ecosystems. For resource exchange, we introduce FlopCoin, a cryptocurrency operating as an incentive scheme for computation offloading and maintained by Internet-connected users called miners. We show how FlopCoin rewards collaborating devices and sidelines selfish ones. For reputation exchange between mobile users, we present OPENRP, a lightweight and scalable middleware that provides a unified interface to applications. OPENRP updates the reputation of participating peers based on their interactions and chooses the best peers with which to collaborate. The traffic generated by applications using OPENRP is lower compared to benchmark strategies. For credit exchange in D2D ecosystems, we propose LocalCoin, a cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices. We prove that under the assumption of a sufficient number of mobile users and adequately selected tuning parameters the probability of double spending converges to zero. Finally, to maintain a decentralized ledger in D2D ecosystems, we design Mneme and propose a consensus protocol that is based on users' context. We prove that the proposed protocol guarantees persistence and liveness, which are essential properties of a distributed ledger.

TITLE: HKUST ACM Programming Team
https://www.cse.ust.hk/acm/news/faq.html
DATE: Tue, 08 Dec 2015 12:20:29 GMT, 5508
Q: What is ACM/ICPC? A: ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (abbreviated as ACM-ICPC or just ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. ICPC is organized by ACM, Association for Computing Machinery. Besides ICPC, ACM hosts many other important events in computer science, e.g., every year ACM will select a Turning Award Winner. Q: What is the benefit of participating programming contests? A: Many. IT companies, and some best trading companies and hedge funds in finance, prefer students that are competitive in algorithms, programming, and math. Many students who have experience in ICPC get the best offers from Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. The skills learned in programming contests not only help you find a good job, but also make you technically component in all areas that are related to computers. Most importantly, solving programming problems is fun. Q: How to enter HKUST ACM Programming Team? A: In middle September every year, we have a team selection contest. Any student in UST can participate this team selection contest. At least six students will be selected as the ACM programming team. Q: When is this year's team selection contest? A: The team selection contest of the year has over, it was held on 13 Sep 2014. Q: What would the team selection contest be like? A: The contestant will be asked to solve 6-8 programming problems within 5 hours, using C++ or Java (Pascal is also allowed, but talk to yinz@ust.hk first). You may want to read problem sets in past years. ("Local Contest" section of http://www.cse.ust.hk/acm/) Q: How to prepare team selection contest? A: Solve problems at Online Judges. 1. USACO Training Gateway, for starters. 2. Codeforces, Topcoder, and POJ to practice on more problems. Coderforces and Topcoder also have solutions to their problems. Q: What is COMP 3071 Honors Competitive Programming? A: This is a training course reserved for the programming team. It is offered in every Spring semester. Only team members who have participated in our weekly training sessions for at least semester and have got a ranking above the 30th in at least one of ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contests are eligible to enroll. The grade will depend on their performance in the ACM-ICPC contests, but will be at least A-. Q: Books to read. A: Algorithm design is the most important skill in programming contests. Many contestants use Introduction to algorithms 2nd/3rd edition. The problems and exercises in textbooks are usually different from the actual contest problems. Textbook is more focused on rigorous thinking, i.e., mathematically proving your algorithm is correct. On the other hand, the programming contest focuses on the tricky and imaginative use of algorithm design techniques, e.g. dynamic programming. Many contestants find books like CLRS too easy for preparing programming contests. This is not true. A good coder not only knows how to solve the problem, but also can quickly reason the correctness of his solution. The sense of "Probably correct" and stopping thinking at this stage is the biggest enemy for intermediate problem solvers to advance. Reading a book like CLRS will train your reasoning ability on the running time and correctness of your algorithms to hard problems. There are also books specifically on contests. An English book is Competitive Programming . Two VERY good books in Chinese are: Link one and Link two. I highly recommend these two books! Q: Have more questions? A: Send emails to Mr Minhao Jiang(mjiangac@cse.ust.hk) © Copyright 1993-2015, HKUST ACM Programming Team,The Department of Computer Science and Engineering,The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

IELM 4110 Investigative Interview and Essay Every IELM 4110 student must interview a practicing engineer or I.T. professional and report on it. This is a golden opportunity to go outside the ivory tower of academia and learn about engineering from an experienced professional! The information below should be helpful to prepare for the interview, conduct the interview and write the essay. Interview Purpose In order to pass the course, every student must interview a practicing engineer or IT professional about his/her first engineering/IT job in Hong Kong and then write and submit a report about the person and what was discussed in the interview. This exercise aims to: offer students the opportunity to talk to industry professionals to get a feel for what they have encountered in their lives help students think about how (and why) to plan a career path show students just a few of the problems and challenges they might encounter along their career paths persuade students to think about what they might want to do in the long term provide real-life examples of how to overcome difficulties make students aware of career opportunities Interview Guidelines Interview a practicing engineer or IT professional about his/her first engineering or IT job in Hong Kong. Practicing engineers are professionals who work (or worked) in the field of engineering (including information technology) and have contributed to the society. They can be alumni from your department, friends, relatives, or anyone willing to talk to you. Do not interview professors or course instructors at HKUST unless they have several years of actual working experience outside academia or unless you want to be one yourself one day. Otherwise, you will miss an opportunity to learn about the daily life pressures and challenges of engineers and I.T. professionals in the commercial world. Academics have their own pressures - like balancing their time in teaching, advising, research and maybe handling administrative affairs - but they may not have much to say about customer service, trouble-shooting, working closely with suppliers or sales and marketing personnel, upgrading skill sets, adjusting career paths, etc. Commercial and non-profit organizations are typically very different, since their goals and sources of funding can be very different. Getting Started Read the guidelines given by the course assistant Ask questions if you don't understand. Select an interviewee Think about an IT professional who seems really interesting or who seems to have special knowledge, qualifications or experience. If possible, browse their companies' web pages to learn more about their work and their backgrounds. Then, select one you feel comfortable in approaching. Ask for an interview Send your selected person an e-mail, asking him/her if he/she would be willing to let you interview him/her so you can learn from him/her about his/her career and work experiences. You can mention that the interview fulfills a requirement of IELM 4110, and you can ask him/her to suggest a convenient date and time to meet. Relax! Most people will be happy to spend the time with you if you ask. If the person you ask declines, then try another. Schedule the interview If the person responds favorably, then make sure you can agree on a time that is not prior to any class or meeting you may have on that date. After the interview, you will be wise to spend one to three hours in a quiet place thinking about the interview, making additional notes, organizing your thoughts and writing the first draft of your report. If you have some other appointment after the interview, you may forget some important details. You need time to be alone and focus on what you learned. Preparing for the Interview Do your homework Find out as much as possible about the person you are interviewing. Nothing is more embarrassing than arriving for an interview and not knowing about your subject. A question like, "Well, Mr. Wong, have you been working here long?" almost guarantees a poor interview. Mr. Wong immediately begins to look at his watch to try to figure out a way to get out of this. A far better question, in the same area, may be, "You were at Stanford for a number of years before coming here. Why did you move? Are glad you did?" In other words, be specific. Briefly outline the questions you want to ask Prepare enough questions to facilitate a good interview and organize them logically and/or topically. In case time does not permit you to ask all your questions, mark the ones that seem to you to be most important. A lot of students ask the following questions: Why did you choose this profession? Can you please tell me about your current job (title, responsibilities, department, nature of projects, etc.)? Can you please tell me about your company and why you chose to work here? How long have you worked for this company? Can you please tell me about your first engineering/IT job (title, responsibilities, department, nature of projects, etc.)? Can you please tell me about that company and why you chose to work there? How long did you worked for that company? In retrospect, what were the major challenges of your first engineering/IT job? How did you adapt to the job? What was the most rewarding experience in the first job? What would you say are the important and unique aspects of working in HK as an engineer/IT professional? Try to ask questions that are open-ended and challenge the interviewee to think You might ask questions like these: Can we talk about the challenges that occurred during your four years at Cambridge? What are the major differences between UCLA, where you taught before coming here, and our school? What is the most satisfying aspect of your job at UST  and why? What factors have contributed to your success? What challenges have you faced? What disappointments have you faced? If you were my age today, what would you do differently? How to Interview Introduce yourself and your goals Make sure that the interviewee knows who you are and what you intend to do during the interview. Be polite and appreciative and not too relaxed. Smile and look him/her in the eyes when he/she talks. An easy approach One easy way to interview is to go through the person's biography with them - letting them know you've already seen the outline on the UST site or wherever - but ask them to expand on it. You'll almost certainly find it easier to get them to tell you more than they otherwise might have if you ask questions randomly. Use your time well Your goal is to help the interviewee talk about things that are interesting to him/her and also useful to you. You want to spend most of your time listening. However, if you feel that he/she has said enough about something, then wait for a pause and politely ask another question. Take handwritten notes on a notepad, but try to keep looking at him/her in the eyes throughout the meeting. Before you leave the interview Thank the interviewee and ask if you can follow up later by e-mail if you feel you have missed anything. After you leave the interview Avoid contact with other people after the interview, so that you can spend at least an hour or two thinking about the person and what he/she said. Go to the library or a quite place and review your notes. Add any further notes while the interview is fresh in your memory. Be prepared to spend one to three hours just thinking about the interview and recording as much as you can recall. You can also highlight important comments and write your own interpretations at this point if you have any. Ideally, you will also begin to organize your thoughts and write the first draft of your report. How to Write Your Essay Essay cover page Be sure to obtain the interviewee's name, phone number or e-mail address and when and where you did the interview. Organize your thoughts Write a brief outline of what you think were the most important things you learned about the interviewee and what lessons you can learn from him/her. Your outline will most likely be very different from your outline of questions. Think of what you would tell your friends or parents about the engineer if you had one minute to do so. Or think about how you would introduce him if you had 30 seconds to say something about him/her before a special talk. After you have the basic outline, you can select details from your notes and add your own interpretations. Try to include the following: A short introduction of the person (name, company, job title, etc.) How you came to know this person Why you chose this person Basic information about the interviewee's first engineering/IT job (company, job title, responsibilities, department, nature of projects, when worked there, etc.) Why the interviewee chose to work there The major challenges of the job How he/she adapt to the job The most rewarding experiences of the first job Important and unique aspects of working in HK as an engineer/IT professional A summary of the main lessons you learned from your interviewee Ask your CT to proofread your report. Essay Guidelines Follow the IELM 4110 essay guidelines Regarding the interviewee, include positive traits that he/she thinks lead to a successful career and a contribution to the society; also mention the challenges of the job and lessons learned. Do not write the entire paper about your theories on life. Focus on the interviewee's ideas and statements. Write in the first person singular Using "I" helps indicate what you think vs. what your subject thinks. But avoid "I think ..." and "In my opinion...". Unless you write "According to Dr. X..." the reader will assume that opinions expressed are your own. Don't just copy what is on the IELM 4110 webpages The graders are very familiar with the web site and will notice. Don't make the entire paper one long quote Use your quotes wisely, and always indicate that it is your subject speaking. Use appropriate parts of speech See Guide to Grammar and Writing. Proofread and run a spell check before submitting your essay If you are going to be a professional one day, you must learn to write professional-looking reports. Help from your communication tutor If you want a communication tutor to offer suggestions for improvement, you can e-mail him/her, but please allow sufficient time. If you submit a draft at the last minute, your tutor may not have much time to help you. No acknowledgements are necessary. For more information see the IELM Course Requirements (MS PowerPoint presentation). After finishing Submit your essay in soft copy to Turnitin. Submit your essay in hard copy to IELM4110 Collection Box, outside IELM Department General Office, Room 5551, via Lift 27-28 Consider e-mailing the report to the interviewee and thanking him/her. Consider showing the report to your parents and/or brothers or sisters and/or telling them about the interview and the essay.

Game FYP Tips Game FYPs usually require a lot of hard work. If you plan and execute well, you can get a good grade on your FYP. In fact, the #1 winning FYP in 2008-2009 was a game! (See the image to the right.) For your reports, you will want to follow the FYP proposal guidelines closely for your proposal, progress report and final report. Also, it is important to seek the help of your communication tutor for your grammar and organization. The second reader will probably be marking partially based on how closely your reports follow the FYP proposal guidelines. For fairness, probably only one second reader will be assigned to all the game FYPs (usually about 10 each year.) Special Tips for Game FYPs In your proposal, include as many pictures and block diagrams as possible, and scatter them throughout the report rather than placing them all at the end. For your proposal, if you don't have any screen images, use preliminary sketches. Include your game scenario in your reports. For your proposal's introduction (section 1.2 Objectives), mention the technical challenges you are facing as you design your game. For example, selecting the game engine, where programming or hacking is needed. Also, mention the CS skills you will need to use. If your advisor requests a hard copy of your proposal, print it in color to make it more attractive. Thanks to Professor Andrew Horner for most of the helpful thoughts on this page.

Zhinan was awarded the 3rd place with his project "Optimization-based Image Decolorization" supervised by Prof Chiew-lan Tai. The conversions from color image to grayscale are indispensable in image processing considering the essential role played by grayscale images in image preprocessing and grayscale printing. However, salient features of color image often disappear in the grayscale result due to some avoidable or unavoidable loss of information in the conversion. This paper presents three robust and efficient color-to-grayscale algorithms based on the algorithm presented by Kim et al. Compared to the original work which considers only the local differences, Zhinan takes the global differences into account. Specifically, he devises three different methods that consider statistics from the image in CIE Lch, in RGB color spaces and consider differences of random chosen pixel by Gaussian pairing. With the project "RFID Noise Identification Using Classification" supervised by Prof Wilfred Ng, Zhijun entered the final round of the competition. The project is about noise identification in radio-frequency identification technology. It improves and utilizes machine learning techniques to perform automatical noise identification using RFID readings. It runs the algorithm using various parameters to achieve good performance. A demonstration application for RFID professionals is also developed to utilize the algorithm. The award presentation ceremony was held on 23 April 2013 at HKUST.

By working as interns, students can develop interest in a particular application sector and specialize in it. The experience may also help to increase the chances of employment after graduation. Duration Depending on the duration, there are different types of full-time internship: Summer internship (2-3 months) Winter internship (1 month) Half-year internship (6-8 months) One-year internship (12-15 months) While summer and winter internships are held outside the university term time, longer-term internships such as half-year and one-year internships, sometimes called placements, are taken during the term time and hence require approval for leave from study. Most companies offering one-year internships only recruit penultimate year students who have completed all except the final year of study. Intended Learning Outcomes Apply knowledge, techniques, skills and tools learned from the Program to a variety of tasks relevant to the computer science and engineering profession; Recognize the operation and requirement of real-life business, leading to understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities; Develop effective interpersonal and teamwork skills; Develop problem-solving skills for a wide range of computer science and engineering problems by taking into consideration various real-life constraints; Recognize the need for lifelong learning and continuing professional development.

Other degrees include an Executive MBA from Kellogg (Northwestern University) and HKUST in 2002, and a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of California at San Diego (Revelle College departmental award, cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1984. I have been a visiting researcher at Columbia University in 1995-96, Bell Laboratories in 1995, and the Technische Universität München (Munich, Germany) during 1986-87. In December 2011, I was selected by the Association for Computational Linguistics as one of only 17 scientists worldwide to be awarded the honor of founding ACL Fellow, with a citation for "significant contributions to machine translation and the development of inversion transduction grammar" which pioneered the integration of syntactic and semantic models into statistical machine translation paradigms. I have served as Associate Editor of Computer Speech and Language, AI Journal, and ACM Transactions on Speech and Language Processing, and on the Editorial Boards of Computational Linguistics, Machine Translation, and Journal of Natural Language Engineering. I also served as Chair of IWSLT 2019, Area Co-Chair for ICLR 2020, ACL 2019, EMNLP 2016, NAACL HLT 2016, IJCAI 2015, ACL 2013, and IJCNLP 2013, Chair of IWSLT 2012, Co-Chair for EMNLP-2004, and the Organizing Committee of ACL-2000 and WVLC-5 (SIGDAT 1997), as well as the Executive Committee of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). In 2007 I initiated the ongoing annual SSST workshop series on Syntax, Semantics, and Structure in Statistical Translation. South China Morning Post has a nice overview of my accomplishments, activities, and approaches. In 2015 Debrett's named me as one of the 100 most influential figures of Hong Kong, in the area of science. In 2019, Google named me as one of eight inaugural members of its AI Ethics council, ATEAC (Advanced Technology External Advisory Council). Research interests Artificial intelligence; human language and music technology; computational linguistics; natural language processing; machine translation; machine learning; neural networks; data science; cognitive models of human language and communication; multilingual computing; language modeling; speech recognition; language acquisition; dialog systems; information retrieval; knowledge management; evolution of language and music; computational musicology; computer music. For machine learning of the relationships between musical languages, we received the ICMC Best Presentation Award from the International Computer Music Association in 2015. For machine learning of the relationships between written and spoken languages, milestone successes pioneered by my statistical machine translation (SMT) research group include: the first unstructured SMT models on very different languages 1993— Chinese/English alignment 1994— Chinese/English statistical machine translation 1994— Chinese/English phrase/collocation translation learning the first syntactic and tree-structured SMT models 1995— inversion transduction grammar (ITG; any synchronous context-free grammar that is binary, ternary, or inverting) 1995— bracketing ITG (BTG or BITG) 1995— stochastic ITG parameter estimation (EM training) 1996— phrasal SMT (segmental ITG) 1997— projection of monolingual constraints (bilingual constraint transfer; coercion) 1998— SMT with lingustic ITG transduction rules 2005— comparable corpora mining BITG 2009— linear inversion transduction grammar (LITG) 2009— linear transduction grammar (LTG) 2011— preterminalized linear inversion transduction grammar (PLITG) 2012— rule chunking for unsupervised transduction grammar grammar induction 2013— rule segmentation for unsupervised transduction grammar grammar induction the first semantic SMT models 2005— word sense disambiguation for SMT (WSD for SMT) 2007— phrase sense disambiguation for SMT (PSD) 2007— semantic role labeling for SMT training (SRL for SMT) 2009— semantic role labeling for SMT decoding (SRL for SMT) 2013— training SMT against purely semantic frame based objective criteria (MEANT) the first semantic MT evaluation models 2010— human semantic MT evaluation with SRL-for-MTE (HMEANT) 2012— automatic semantic MT evaluation with SRL-for-MTE (MEANT) 2014— cross-lingual automatic semantic MT evaluation without human references (XMEANT) some of this is surveyed in my 2010 chapters "Alignment" in CRC Press' Handbook of Natural Language Processing "Lexical Semantics for Statistical Machine Translation" in DARPA's Handbook of Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation Our active research projects are internationally funded by the US DARPA BOLT, GALE, and LORELEI programs, the European Union EU-BRIDGE project, and the Hong Kong RGC.

We introduce (1) a novel neural network structure for bilingual modeling of sentence pairs that allows efficient capturing of bilingual relationships via biconstituent composition, (2) the concept of neural network biparsing, which applies to not only machine translation (MT) but also to a variety of other bilingual research areas, and (3) the concept of a biparsing-backpropagation training loop, which we hypothesize that can efficiently learn complex biparse tree patterns. Our work distinguishes from sequential attention-based models, which are more traditionally found in neural machine translation (NMT) in three aspects. First, our model enforces compositional constraints. Second, our model has a smaller search space in terms of discovering bilingual relationships from bilingual sentence pairs. Third, our model produces explicit biparse trees, which enable transparent error analysis during evaluation and external tree constraints during training. Meriem BELOUCIF and Dekai WU. "SRL for low resource languages isn't needed for semantic SMT". 21st Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT 2018). Alicante: May 2018. Previous attempts at injecting semantic frame biases into SMT training for low resource languages failed because either (a) no semantic parser is available for the low resource input language; or (b) the output English language semantic parses excise relevant parts of the alignment space too aggressively. We present the first semantic SMT model to succeed in significantly improving translation quality across many low resource input languages for which no automatic SRL is available — consistently and across all common MT metrics. The results we report are the best by far to date for this type of approach; our analyses suggest that in general, easier approaches toward including semantics in training SMT models may be more feasible than generally assumed even for low resource languages where semantic parsers remain scarce. While recent proposals to use the crosslingual evaluation metric XMEANT during inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction are inapplicable to low resource languages that lack semantic parsers, we break the bottleneck via a vastly improved method of biasing ITG induction toward learning more semantically correct alignments using the monolingual semantic evaluation metric MEANT. Unlike XMEANT, MEANT requires only a readily-available English (output language) semantic parser. The advances we report here exploit the novel realization that MEANT represents an excellent way to semantically bias expectation-maximization induction even for low resource languages. We test our systems on challenging languages including Amharic, Uyghur, Tigrinya and Oromo. Results show that our model influences the learning towards more semantically correct alignments, leading to better translation quality than both the standard ITG or GIZA++ based SMT training models on different datasets.

"Handling Ties Correctly and Efficiently in Viterbi Training Using the Viterbi Semiring". 12th International Conference on Language and Automata Theory and Applications (LATA 2018). Tel Aviv, Israel: Apr 2018. The handling of ties between equiprobable derivations during Viterbi training is often glossed over in research paper, whether they are broken randomly when they occur, or on an ad-hoc basis decided by the algorithm or implementation, or whether all equiprobable derivations are enumerated with the counts uniformly distributed among them, is left to the readers imagination. The first hurts rarely occurring rules, which run the risk of being randomly eliminated, the second suffers from algorithmic biases, and the last is correct but potentially very inefficient. We show that it is possible to Viterbi train correctly without enumerating all equiprobable best derivations. The method is analogous to expectation maximization, given that the automatic differentiation view is chosen over the reverse value/outside probability view, as the latter calculates the wrong quantity for reestimation under the Viterbi semiring. To get the automatic differentiation to work we devise an unbiased subderivative for the max function. Meriem BELOUCIF and Dekai WU. "Semantically Driven Inversion Transduction Grammar Induction for Early Stage Training of Spoken Language Translation". Sixth IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2016). San Diego: Dec 2016. We propose an approach in which we inject a crosslingual semantic frame based objective function directly into inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction in order to semantically train spoken language translation systems. This approach represents a follow-up of our recent work on improving machine translation quality by tuning loglinear mixture weights using a semantic frame based objective function in the late, final stage of statistical machine translation training. In contrast, our new approach injects a semantic frame based objective function back into earlier stages of the training pipeline, during the actual learning of the translation model, biasing learning toward semantically more accurate alignments. Our work is motivated by the fact that ITG alignments have empirically been shown to fully cover crosslingual semantic frame alternations. We show that injecting a crosslingual semantic based objective function for driving ITG induction further sharpens the ITG constraints, leading to better performance than either the conventional ITG or the traditional GIZA++ based approaches.

Osaka, Japan: Dec 2016. We introduce a new statistical machine translation approach specifically geared to learning translation from low resource languages, that exploits monolingual English semantic parsing to bias inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction. We show that in contrast to conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) training methods, which rely heavily on phrase memorization, our approach focuses on learning bilingual correlations that help translating low resource languages, by using the output language semantic structure to further narrow down ITG constraints. This approach is motivated by previous research which has shown that injecting a semantic frame based objective function while training SMT models improves the translation quality. We show that including a monolingual semantic objective function during the learning of the translation model leads towards a semantically driven alignment which is more efficient than simply tuning loglinear mixture weights against a semantic frame based evaluation metric in the final stage of statistical machine translation training. We test our approach with three different language pairs and demonstrate that our model biases the learning towards more semantically correct alignments. Both GIZA++ and ITG based techniques fail to capture meaningful bilingual constituents, which is required when trying to learn translation models for low resource languages. In contrast, our proposed model not only improve translation by injecting a monolingual objective function to learn bilingual correlations during early training of the translation model, but also helps to learn more meaningful correlations with a relatively small data set, leading to a better alignment compared to either conventional ITG or traditional GIZA++ based approaches.

Oriental COCOSDA 2016, 19th International Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Committee for the Co-ordination and Standardization of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques (O-COCOSDA 2016). Bali, Indonesia: Oct 2016. We describe a new approach for semantically training spoken language translation systems, in which we inject a crosslingual semantic frame based objective function directly into inversion transduction grammar (ITG) induction. This represents an ambitious jump from recent work on improving translation adequacy by using a semantic frame based objective function to drive the tuning of loglinear mixture weights in the final stage of statistical machine translation training. In contrast, our new approach propagates a semantic frame based objective function back into much earlier stages of the pipeline, during the actual learning of the translation model, biasing learning toward semantically more accurate alignments. This approach is motivated by the fact that ITG alignments have empirically been shown to fully cover crosslingual semantic frame alternations, even though they rule out an overwhelming majority of the space of possible alignments. We show that directly driving ITG induction with a crosslingual semantic based objective function not only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids excising relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches. Meriem BELOUCIF and Dekai WU. "Driving inversion transduction grammar induction with semantic evaluation". 5th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2016), at ACL 2016, 55-63. Berlin: Aug 2016. We describe a new technique for improving statistical machine translation training by adopting scores from a recent crosslingual semantic frame based evaluation metric, XMEANT, as outside probabilities in expectation-maximization based ITG (inversion transduction grammars) alignment. Our new approach strongly biases early-stage SMT learning towards semantically valid alignments. Unlike previous attempts that have proposed using semantic frame based evaluation metrics as the objective function for late-stage tuning of less than a dozen loglinear mixture weights, our approach instead applies the semantic metric at one of the earliest stages of SMT training, where it may impact millions of model parameters. The choice of XMEANT is motivated by empirical studies that have shown ITG constraints to cover almost all crosslingual semantic frame alternations, which resemble the crosslingual semantic frame matching measured by XMEANT. Our experiments purposely restrict training data to small amounts to show the technique's utility in the absence of a huge corpus, to study the effects of semantic generalizations while avoiding overreliance on memorization. Results show that directly driving ITG training with the crosslingual semantic frame based objective function not only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids excising relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches.

We describe a generalization of stochastic transduction grammars to be able to model continuous values, the first models to natively handle continuous-valued musical events such as microtones while still gaining the advantages of STGs for describing complex structural, hierarchically compositional inter-part relationships. Music transduction modeling based on linguistic or grammatical models have commonly approximated continuous valued features like pitch by quantizing them into discrete symbols, which represent `clean' notes on a scale. The sacrifice is worthwhile for modeling the learning of musical improvisation and accompaniment where musical sequences interact hierarchically at many overlapping levels of granularity; previous work has shown in flamenco and hip hop how discrete STGs allow each part to influence decisions made by other parts while also satisfying contextual preferences across multiple dimensions. We extend the modeling machinery toward the many musical genres where contextual relationships between continuous values influence improvisational and accompaniment decisions. Illustrating using the `bent notes' prevalent in blues, we show how continuous STGs can be generalized from conventional discrete STGs which have until now only been able to handle symbolic events, thereby allowing musical signals to remain finely represented as continuous values without crude quantization into discrete symbols, while still retaining the ability to model probabilistic structural relations between multiple musical languages. We exemplify this new approach in learning blues notes biases via a new polynomial time algorithm for expectation-maximization training of continuous SITGs (stochastic inversion transduction grammars), a specific subclass of STGs that has already proven useful in numerous applications in both music and language. Meriem BELOUCIF and Dekai WU. "A semantically confidence-weighted ITG induction algorithm". 3rd International Workshop on Semantic Machine Learning (SML 2016), at IJCAI 2016. New York: Jul 2016. We propose a new algorithm to induce inversion transduction grammars, in which a crosslingual semantic frame based objective function is injected as confidence weighting in the early stages of statistical machine translation training. Unlike recent work on improving translation adequacy that uses a monolingual semantic frame based objective function to drive the tuning of loglinear mixture weights in the late stages of statistical machine translation training, our bilingual approach incorporates the semantic objective during the actual learning of the translation model's structure. Our approach assigns higher confidence to training examples in which the semantic frames in the input language more closely match the semantic frames of the output language, as predicted automatically by XMEANT, the crosslingual semantic frame based machine translation evaluation metric. We chose to apply this approach to induce inversion transduction grammars (ITGs), since ITG alignments prune a large majority of the space of possible alignments, while at the same time empirically fully covering all the crosslingual semantic frame alternations of the type we are using for confidence weighting. Results show that boosting semantically compatible training examples in ITG induction improves the translation performance compared to either traditional GIZA++ alignment or conventional ITG alignment based approaches for phrase based statistical machine translation. Dekai WU. "How Blue Can You Get? Learning Structural Relationships for Microtones via Continuous Stochastic Transduction Grammars". Seventh International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC 2016). Paris: Jun 2016. We describe a new approach to probabilistic modeling of structural inter-part relationships between continuous-valued musical events such as microtones, through a novel class of continuous stochastic transduction grammars. Linguistic and grammar oriented models for music commonly approximate features like pitch using discrete symbols to represent ‘clean’ notes on scales. In many musical genres, however, contextual relationships between continuous values are essential to improvisational and accompaniment decisions—as with the ‘bent notes’ that blues rely heavily upon. In this paper, we study how stochastic transduction grammars or STGs, which have until now only been able to handle discrete symbols, can be generalized to model continuous valued features for such applications. STGs are interesting for modeling the learning of musical improvisation and accompaniment where parallel musical sequences interact hierarchically (compositionally) at many overlapping levels of granularity. Each part influences decisions made by other parts while at the same time satisfying contextual preferences across multiple dimensions; applications to flamenco and hip hop have recently been shown using discrete STGs. We propose to use a formulation of continuous STGs in which musical signals are finely represented as continuous values without crude quantization into discrete symbols, yet still retaining the ability to model probabilistic structural relations between multiple musical languages. We instantiate this approach for the specific class of stochastic inversion transduction grammars (SITGs), which has proven useful in many applications, via a polynomial time algorithm for expectation-maximization training of continuous SITGs. Dekai WU. "Learning Musical Creativity via Stochastic Transduction Grammars: Combination, Exploration and Transformation". Fourth International Workshop on Musical Metacreation (MUME 2016)). Paris: Jun 2016. We discuss how Boden’s creative processes of combination, exploration, and transformation naturally emerge in models that learn musical improvisation via stochastic transduction grammar induction. Unlike a conventional monolingual grammar, a transduction grammar represents complex transformative relationships between one representation language and another. For musical improvisation, a transduction grammar both provides a large (typically infinite) space of possible hierarchical combinations, and defines a combinatorial space to explore. A stochastic transduction grammar (STG) allows controlled randomness in the combination and exploration. We have been developing STG based models in recent work on learning musical improvisation for hip hop, flamenco, and blues. Inducing an STG simultaneously (a) identifies chunks that will become candidates for recombination as well as patterns of combination, (b) constructs a new spaces for exploration in improvisation and composition, and (c) learns transformations from one representation to another.

Workshop on Multilingual and Cross-lingual Methods in NLP (at NAACL HLT 2016), 55-64. San Diego: Jun 2016. We tackle the challenge of learning part-of-speech classified translations as part of an inversion transduction grammar, by learning translations for English words with known part-of-speech tags, both from existing translation lexica and from parallel corpora. When translating from a low resource language into English, we can expect to have rich resources for English, such as treebanks, and small amounts of bilingual resources, such as translation lexica and parallel corpora. We solve the problem of integrating these heterogeneous resources into a single model using stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars, which we augment with wildcards to handle unknown translations.

We demonstrate a rap battle bot that autonomously learns to freestyle creatively in real time, via a fast new hybrid compositional improvisation model integrating symbolic transduction grammar induction with novel bilingual recursive neural networks. Given that rap and hip hop represent one of music's most influential recent developments, surprisingly little research has been done in music technology. In true rap battling---the genre's most difficult form---an appropriate output response must be improvised whenever challenged by some input line of lyrics. As with many musical improvisation tasks, modeling the creative process is complex because it requires compositionality: improvising a good response not only requires making salient associations with the challenge at many overlapping levels of granularity, but simultaneously satisfying contextual preferences across a wide variety of dimensions. Our new real-time system accomplishes this via an efficient, recursive, neurally guided stochastic grammar-based transducer. The neural network is a newly enhanced version of our recently developed TRAAM (transduction recursive auto-associative memory) model. We demonstrate strong connections between music and language processing and learning---the freestyle learning capability arises from exactly the same compositional structure learning model that autonomously learns semantic interpretation / translation models as well as other music improvisation models.

We show that applying semantic role label constraints to bracketing ITG alignment to train MT systems improves the quality of MT output in comparison to the conventional BITG and GIZA alignments. Moreover, we show that applying soft constraints to SRL-constrained BITG alignment leads to a better translation system compared to using hard constraints which appear too harsh to produce meaningful biparses. We leverage previous work demonstrating that BITG alignments are able to fully cover cross-lingual semantic frame alternations, by using semantic role labeling to further narrow BITG constraints, in a soft fashion that avoids losing relevant portions of the search space. SRL-based evaluation metrics like MEANT have shown that tuning towards preserving the shallow semantic structure across translations, robustly improves translation performance. Our approach brings the same intuition into the training phase. We show that our new alignment outperforms both conventional Moses and BITG alignment baselines in terms of the adequacy-oriented MEANT scores, while still producing comparable results in terms of edit distance metrics. Dekai WU and Karteek ADDANKI. "Neural Versus Symbolic Rap Battle Bots". 41st International Computer Music Conference (ICMC 2015). Denton, Texas: Sep 2015. We contrast two opposing approaches to building bots that autonomously learn to rap battle: a symbolic probabilistic approach based on induction of stochastic transduction grammars, versus a neural network approach based on backpropagation through unconventional transduction recursive auto-associative memory (TRAAM) models. Rap battling is modeled as a quasi-translation problem, in which an appropriate output response must be improvised given any input challenge line of lyrics. Both approaches attempt to tackle the difficult problem of compositionality: for any challenge line, constructing a good response requires making salient associations while satisfying contextual preferences at many different, overlapping levels of granularity between the challenge and response lines. The contextual preferences include fluency, partial metrical or syntactic parallelism, and rhyming at various points across the lines. During both the learning and improvisation stages, the symbolic approach attempts to explicitly enumerate as many hypotheses as possible, whereas the neural approach attempts to evolve vector representations that better implicitly generalize over soft regions or neighborhoods of hypotheses. The brute force symbolic approach is more precise, but quickly generates combinatorial numbers of hypotheses when searching for generalizations. The distributed vector based neural approach can more easily confuse hypotheses, but maintains a constant level of complexity while retaining its implicit generalization bias. We contrast both the theoretical formulation and experimental outputs of the two approaches. Chi-kiu LO, Philipp C. DOWLING, and Dekai WU. "Improving evaluation and optimization of MT systems against MEANT". 10th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (at EMNLP 2015), 434-441. Lisbon: Sep 2015. We show that, consistent with MEANT-tuned systems that translate into Chinese, MEANT-tuned MT systems that translate into English also outperforms BLEU-tuned system across commonly used MT evaluation metrics, even in BLEU. The result is achieved by significantly improving MEANT's sentence-level ranking correlation with human preferences through incorporating a more accurate distributional semantic model for lexical similarity and a novel backoff algorithm for evaluating MT output which automatic semantic parser fails to parse. Our surprising results of MEANT-tuned systems having a higher BLEU score than BLEU-tuned systems suggests that MEANT is a more accurate objective function guiding the development of MT systems towards producing more adequate translation. Dekai WU. "Compositional bilingual artificial neural networks for predicting hypermetrical structure among interacting flamenco parts". 2015 Biennial Meeting of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (SMPC 2015). Nashville, Tennessee: Aug 2015. Particularly in traditional, improvisational genres such as flamenco or jazz, much of music can be seen as parallel musical sequences that interact such that each part influences decisions made by other parts. We recently suggested leveraging the formal language theory notion of transduction grammars, in stochastic forms, to model each part as a musical language (Wu 2013). The advantage is that stochastic transductions can be exploited to model the probabilistic, ambiguous, complex structural relationships between interacting parts. Transduction grammar induction techniques can then be used to model unsupervised learning of musical accompaniment and improvisation. We explore an alternative approach carrying many of the same properties, but instead using artificial neural networks to learn compositional distributed vector representations that implicitly encode structural relationships between associated portions of two different musical parts. As with symbolic transduction grammars, these structural association patterns can range from concrete to abstract patterns, and from short to long patterns. Unlike symbolic transduction grammars, a single vector encodes a “soft” set of multiple similar hypotheses in the same neighborhood, because similar vectors tend to be learned for association patterns that are similar—cutting down the combinatorial growth of hypotheses inherent in the symbolic approaches. Since conventional neural networks have difficulty representing compositional structures, we propose to use a bilingual generalization of Pollack’s (1990) recursive auto-associative memory. Whereas Pollack’s RAAM can be seen as a neural approximation of a single compositional language model, our TRAAM (Transduction RAAM) approach is a neural approximation of a bilingual compositional transduction model—a relation between two probabilistically structured musical languages. We discuss empirical analyses of the learning behavior of our new neural approach on the hypermetrical structure prediction problem in flamenco, where meter changes can be rapidly influenced by multiple parts. Dekai WU and Karteek ADDANKI. " Learning to Rap Battle with Bilingual Recursive Neural Networks". 24th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-15). Buenos Aires: Jul 2015. We describe an unconventional line of attack in our quest to teach machines how to rap battle by improvising lyrics on the fly, in which a novel recursive bilingual neural network implicitly learns soft, context-sensitive generalizations over the structural relationships between associated parts of challenge and response raps, while avoiding the exponential complexity costs that symbolic models would require. Our recursive bilingual neural network learns the feature vectors simultaneously using context from both the challenge and the response such that challenge-response association patterns with similar structure tend to have similar vectors. Improvisation is modeled as a quasi-translation learning problem and our recursive bilingual neural network is trained to improvise fluent and rhyming responses to hip hop lyrical challenges. The soft structural relationships learned by our recursive bilingual neural network are used to improve the probabilistic responses generated by our improvisational response component.

Lake Tahoe, California: Dec 2014. We discuss various improvements to our MEANT tuned system, previously presented at IWSLT 2013. In our 2014 system, we incorporate this year's improved version of MEANT, improved Chinese word segmentation, Chinese named entity recognition and dedicated proper name translation, and number expression handling. This results in a significant performance jump compared to last year's system. We also ran preliminary experiments on tuning to IMEANT, our new ITG based variant of MEANT. The performance of tuning to IMEANT is comparable to tuning on MEANT (differences are statistically insignificant). We are presently investigating if tuning on IMEANT can produce even better results, since IMEANT was actually shown to correlate with human adequacy judgment more closely than MEANT. Finally, we ran experiments applying our new architectural improvements to a contrastive system tuned to BLEU. We observed a slightly higher jump in comparison to last year, possibly due to mismatches of MEANT's similarity models to our new entity handling.

Proceedings of SSST-8, Eighth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (at EMNLP 2014), 22-33. Doha: Oct 2014. We introduce an inversion transduction grammar based restructuring of the MEANT automatic semantic frame based MT evaluation metric, which, by leveraging ITG language biases, is able to further improve upon MEANT's already-high correlation with human adequacy judgments. The new metric, called IMEANT, uses bracketing ITGs to biparse the reference and machine translations, but subject to obeying the semantic frames in both. Resulting improvements support the presumption that ITGs, which constrain the allowable permutations between compositional segments across the reference and MT output, score the phrasal similarity of the semantic role fillers more accurately than the simple word alignment heuristics (bag-of-word alignment or maximum alignment) used in previous version of MEANT. The approach successfully integrates (1) the previously demonstrated extremely high coverage of cross-lingual semantic frame alternations by ITGs, with (2) the high accuracy of evaluating MT via weighted f-scores on the degree of semantic frame preservation.

Proceedings of SSST-8, Eighth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (at EMNLP 2014), 112-121. Doha: Oct 2014. We introduce TRAAM, or Transduction RAAM, a fully bilingual generalization of Pollack's (1990) monolingual Recursive Auto-Associative Memory neural network model, in which each distributed vector represents a bilingual constituent—i.e., an instance of a transduction rule, which specifies a relation between two monolingual constituents and how their subconstituents should be permuted. Bilingual terminals are special cases of bilingual constituents, where a vector represents either (1) a bilingual token—a token-to-token or ``word-to-word'' translation rule—or (2) a bilingual segment—a segment-to-segment or ``phrase-to-phrase'' translation rule. TRAAMs have properties that appear attractive for bilingual grammar induction and statistical machine translation applications. Training of TRAAM drives both the autoencoder weights and the vector representations to evolve, such that similar bilingual constituents tend to have more similar vectors. Markus SAERS and Dekai WU. "Ternary Segmentation for Improving Search in Top-down Induction of Segmental ITGs". Proceedings of SSST-8, Eighth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (at EMNLP 2014), 48-57. Doha: Oct 2014. We show that there are situations where iteratively segmenting sentence pairs top-down will fail to reach valid segments and propose a method for alleviating the problem. Due to the enormity of the search space, error analysis has indicated that it is often impossible to get to a desired embedded segment purely through binary segmentation that divides existing segmental rules in half – the strategy typically employed by existing search strategies – as it requires two steps. We propose a new method to hypothesize ternary segmentations in a single step, making the embedded segments immediately discoverable. Chi-kiu LO and Dekai WU. "BiMEANT: Integrating cross-lingual and monolingual semantic frame similarities in the MEANT semantic MT evaluation metric". In Laurent BESACIER and Adrian-Horia DEDIU and Carlos MARTÍN-VIDE (editors), Second International Conference on Statistical Language and Speech Processing (SLSP 2014), 82-93. Grenoble, France: Oct 2014. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 7978, 2014. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. We present experimental results showing that integrating cross-lingual semantic frame similarity into the semantic frame based automatic MT evaluation metric MEANT improves its correlation with human judgment on evaluating translation adequacy. Recent work shows that MEANT more accurately reflects translation adequacy than other automatic MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU or TER, and that moreover, optimizing SMT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality across different output languages. However, in some cases the human reference translation employs different scoping strategies from the input sentence and thus standard monolingual MEANT, which only assesses translation quality via the semantic frame similarity between the reference and machine translations, fails to fairly and accurately reward the adequacy of the machine translation. To address this issue we propose a new bilingual metric, BiMEANT, that correlates with human judgment more closely than MEANT by incorporating new cross-lingual semantic frame similarity assessments into MEANT.

"Lexical Access Preference and Constraint Strategies for Improving Multiword Expression Association within Semantic MT Evaluation". 4th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex), at Coling 2014, 144-153. Dublin, Ireland: Aug 2014. We examine lexical access preferences and constraints in computing multiword expression associations from the standpoint of a high-impact extrinsic task-based performance measure, namely semantic machine translation evaluation. In automated MT evaluation metrics, machine translations are compared against human reference translations, which are almost never worded exactly the same way except in the most trivial of cases. Because of this, one of the most important factors in correctly predicting semantic translation adequacy is the accuracy of recognizing alternative lexical realizations of the same multiword expressions in semantic role fillers. Our results comparing bag-of-words, maximum alignment, and inversion transduction grammars indicate that cognitively motivated ITGs provide superior lexical access characteristics for multiword expression associations, leading to state-of-the-art improvements in correlation with human adequacy judgments.

"XMEANT: Better semantic MT evaluation without reference translations". 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2014), 765-771. Baltimore, Maryland: Jun 2014. We introduce XMEANT---a new cross-lingual version of the semantic frame based MT evaluation metric MEANT---which can correlate even more closely with human adequacy judgments than monolingual MEANT and eliminates the need for expensive human references. Previous work established that MEANT reflects translation adequacy with state-of-the-art accuracy, and optimizing MT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality. However, to go beyond tuning weights in the loglinear SMT model, a cross-lingual objective function that can deeply integrate semantic frame criteria into the MT training pipeline is needed. We show that cross-lingual XMEANT outperforms monolingual MEANT by (1) replacing the monolingual context vector model in MEANT with simple translation probabilities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG constraints.

Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2014). Reykjavik, Iceland: May 2014. We present analyses showing that HMEANT is a reliable, accurate and fine-grained semantic frame based human MT evaluation metric with high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and correlation with human adequacy judgments, despite only requiring a minimal training of about 15 minutes for lay annotators. Previous work shows that the IAA on the semantic role labeling (SRL) subtask within HMEANT is over 70%. In this paper we focus on (1) the IAA on the semantic role alignment task and (2) the overall IAA of HMEANT. Our results show that the IAA on the alignment task of HMEANT is over 90% when humans align SRL output from the same SRL annotator, which shows that the instructions on the alignment task are sufficiently precise, although the overall IAA where humans align SRL output from different SRL annotators falls to only 61% due to the pipeline effect on the disagreement in the two annotation task. We show that instead of manually aligning the semantic roles using an automatic algorithm not only helps maintaining the overall IAA of HMEANT at 70%, but also provides a finer-grained assessment on the phrasal similarity of the semantic role fillers. This suggests that HMEANT equipped with automatic alignment is reliable and accurate for humans to evaluate MT adequacy while achieving higher correlation with human adequacy judgments than HTER.

Reykjavik, Iceland: May 2014. We investigate novel challenges involved in comparing model performance on the task of improvising responses to hip hop lyrics and discuss observations regarding inter-evaluator agreement on judging improvisation quality. We believe the analysis serves as a first step toward designing robust evaluation strategies for improvisation tasks, a relatively neglected area to date. Unlike most natural language processing tasks, improvisation tasks suffer from a high degree of subjectivity, making it difficult to design discriminative evaluation strategies to drive model development. We propose a simple strategy with fluency and rhyming as the criteria for evaluating the quality of generated responses, which we apply to both our inversion transduction grammar based FREESTYLE hip hop challenge-response improvisation system, as well as various contrastive systems. We report inter-evaluator agreement for both English and French hip hop lyrics, and analyze correlation with challenge length. We also compare the extent of agreement in evaluating fluency with that of rhyming, and quantify the difference in agreement with and without precise definitions of evaluation criteria. Dekai WU.

"The Magic Number 4: Evolutionary Pressures on Semantic Frame Structure". 10th International Conference on the Evolution of Language (Evolang X). Vienna: Apr 2014. We propose that the ``magic number 4'' puzzle of argument structure in semantic frames across most human languages is explained by selection pressures given inherent computational efficiency properties naturally arising from fundamental combinatorial mathematics of compositionality. Irrespective of language, school, or theoretical bias, linguists have long observed that what are now generally called ``semantic frames'' empirically bear a maximum limit of four core arguments per frame, for unknown reasons. We explain how this limit would automatically emerge as a consequence of evolutionary preference for the formal equivalence class of inversion transductions as an optimal balance between expressivity and fast tractable polynomial-time language learning and interpretation/transduction between different representation languages. Dekai WU. "Learning Music and Language with Stochastic Transduction Grammars". EvoMus Workshop on The Evolution of Music and Language in a Comparative Perspective. Vienna: Apr 2014. We discuss how our computational models for learning probabilistic structural relationships between pairs of compositional languages reflect fundamental cognitive capacities that underlie both human language and music processing. Formally, a single language can be described by a (probabilistically weighted) set of patterns; likewise, a bilingual/bimodal transduction can be described by a set of structurally related pattern pairs. The probabilistic rules in stochastic transduction grammars, which we pioneered and are widely used in statistical machine translation, associate compositional patterns between two representation languages—a generalized version of Saussurean signs. Our cognitively motivated transduction grammar induction methods learn by bootstrapping progressively more complex classes of transductions, from finite-state to linear to inversion transductions. Linguistically, inversion transduction grammars explain via combinatorial efficiency principles why natural languages evolved universally to impose a long-unexplained empirical limit on the number of core arguments in semantic frames to the “magic number 4”. Musically, our work demonstrates that the same transduction grammar induction processes model the learning and use of compositional relationships between parallel musical representation languages—languages for example like hypermetrically structured rhythm parts in flamenco, or lines and rhymes in hip hop.

Heidelberg, Germany: Dec 2013. We present the first ever results showing that Chinese MT output is significantly improved by tuning a MT system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, rather than an n-gram based objective function, BLEU, as measured across commonly used metrics and different test sets. Recent work showed that by preserving the meaning of the translations as captured by semantic frames in the training process, MT systems for translating into English on both formal and informal genres are constrained to produce more adequate translations by making more accurate choices on lexical output and reordering rules. In this paper we describe our experiments in IWSLT 2013 TED talk MT tasks on tuning MT systems against MEANT for translating into Chinese and English respectively. We show that the Chinese translation output benefits more from tuning a MT system against MEANT than the English translation output due to the ambiguous nature of word boundaries in Chinese. Our encouraging results show that using MEANT is a promising alternative to BLEU in both evaluating and tuning MT systems to drive the progress of MT research across different languages.

We present the results of large-scale human semantic MT evaluation with HMEANT on the IWSLT 2013 German-English MT and SLT tracks and show that HMEANT evaluates the performance of the MT systems differently compared to BLEU and TER. Together with the references, all the translations are annotated by annotators who are native English speakers in both semantic role labeling stage and role filler alignment stage of HMEANT. We obtain high inter-annotator agreement and low annotation time costs which indicate that it is feasible to run a large-scale human semantic MT evaluation campaign using HMEANT. Our results also show that HMEANT is a robust and reliable semantic MT evaluation metric for running large-scale evaluation campaigns as it is inexpensive and simple while maintaining the semantic representational transparency to provide a perspective which is different from BLEU and TER in order to understand the performance of the state-of-the-art MT systems.

Nara, Japan: Nov 2013. [Short version entitled "Unsupervised Learning of Bilingual Categories in Inversion Transduction Grammar Induction" at IWSLT 2013.] We present the first known experiments incorporating unsupervised bilingual nonterminal category learning within end-to-end fully unsupervised transduction grammar induction using matched training and testing models. Despite steady recent progress, such induction experiments until now have not allowed for learning differentiated nonterminal categories. We divide the learning into two stages: (1) a bootstrap stage that generates a large set of categorized short transduction rule hypotheses, and (2) a minimum conditional description length stage that simultaneously prunes away less useful short rule hypotheses, while also iteratively segmenting full sentence pairs into useful longer categorized transduction rules. We show that the second stage works better when the rule hypotheses have categories than when they do not, and that the proposed conditional description length approach combines the rules hypothesized by the two stages better than a mixture model does. We also show that the compact model learned during the second stage can be further improved by combining the result of different iterations in a mixture model. In total, we see a jump in BLEU score, from 17.53 for a standalone minimum description length baseline with no category learning, to 20.93 when incorporating category induction on a Chinese--English translation task.

"Simultaneous Unsupervised Learning of Flamenco Metrical Structure, Hypermetrical Structure, and Multipart Structural Relations". 14th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2013), 155-160. Curitiba, Brazil: Nov 2013. We show how a new unsupervised approach to learning musical relationships can exploit Bayesian MAP induction of stochastic transduction grammars to overcome the challenges of learning complex relationships between multiple rhythmic parts that previously lay outside the scope of general computational approaches to music structure learning. A good illustrative genre is flamenco, which employs not only regular but also irregular hypermetrical structures that rapidly switch between 3/4 and 6/8 mediocompas blocks. Moreover, typical flamenco idioms employ heavy syncopation and sudden, misleading off-beat accents and patterns, while often elliding the downbeat accents that humans as well as existing meter-finding algorithms rely on, thus creating a high degree of listener “surprise'” that makes not only the structural relations, but even the metrical structure itself, ellusive to learn. Flamenco musicians rely on both complex regular hypermetrical knowledge as well as irregular real-time clues to recognize when to switch meters and patterns. Our new approach envisions this as an integrated problem of learning a bilingual transduction, i.e., a structural relation between two languages—where there are different musical languages of, say, flamenco percussion versus zapateado footwork or palmas hand clapping. We apply minimum description length criteria to induce transduction grammars that simultaneously learn (1) the multiple metrical structures, (2) the hypermetrical structure that stochastically governs meter switching, and (3) the probabilistic transduction relationship between patterns of different rhythmic languages that enables musicians to predict when to switch meters and how to select patterns depending on what fellow musicians are generating.

"Learning to Freestyle: Hip Hop Challenge-Response Induction via Transduction Rule Segmentation". 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2013), 102-112. Seattle: Oct 2013. We attack an inexplicably under-explored language genre of spoken language—lyrics in music—via completely unsupervised induction of an SMT-style stochastic transduction grammar for hip hop lyrics, yielding a fully-automatically learned challenge-response system that produces rhyming lyrics given an input. Unlike previous efforts, we choose the domain of hip hop lyrics, which is particularly unstructured and noisy. A novel feature of our approach is that it is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori linguistic or phonetic knowledge. In spite of the level of difficulty of the challenge, the model nevertheless produces fluent output as judged by human evaluators, and performs significantly better than widely used phrase-based SMT models upon the same task.

Nagoya, Japan: Oct 2013. We present a novel approach to learning phrasal inversion transduction grammars via Bayesian MAP (maximum a posteriori) or information-theoretic MDL (minimum description length) model optimization so as to incorporate simultaneously the choices of model structure as well as parameters. In comparison to most current SMT approaches, the model learns phrase translation lexicons that (a) do not require enormous amounts of run-time memory, (b) contain significantly less redundancy, and (c) provide an obvious basis for generalization to abstract translation schemas. Model structure choice is biased by a description length prior, while parameter choice is driven by data likelihood biased by a parameter prior. The search over possible model structures is made feasible by a novel top-down rule segmenting heuristic which efficiently incorporates estimates of the posterior probabilities. Since the priors reward model parsimony, the learned grammar is very concise and still performs significantly better than the maximum likelihood driven bottom-up rule chunking baseline.

Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2013). Hissar, Bulgaria: Sep 2013. We present an unsupervised learning model that induces phrasal inversion transduction grammars by introducing a minimum conditional description length (CDL) principle to drive search over a space defined by two opposing extreme types of ITGs. Our approach attacks the difficulty of acquiring more complex longer rules when inducing inversion transduction grammars via unsupervised bottom-up chunking, by augmenting its model search with top-down segmentation that minimizes CDL, resulting in significant translation accuracy gains. Chunked rules tend to be relatively short; long rules are hard to learn through chunking, as the smaller parts of the long rules may not necessarily be good translations themselves. Our objective criterion is a conditional adaptation of the notion of description length, that is conditioned on a fixed preexisting model, in this case the initial chunked ITG. The notion of minimum CDL (MCDL) facilitates a novel strategy for avoiding the pitfalls of premature pruning in chunking approaches, by incrementally splitting an ITG with reference to a second ITG that conditions this search.

We cast the problem of hip hop lyric generation as a translation problem, automatically learn a machine translation system that accepts hip hop lyric challenges and improvises rhyming responses, and show that improving the training data by learning an unsupervised rhyme detection scheme further improves performance. Our approach using unsupervised induction of stochastic transduction grammars is the first to apply the learning algorithms of SMT to the woefully under-explored genre of lyrics in music. A novel feature of our model is that it is completely unsupervised and does not make use of any a priori linguistic or phonetic information. Unlike the handful of previous approaches to modeling lyrics, we choose the domain of hip hop lyrics which is particularly noisy and unstructured. In order to cope with the noisy nature of the data in this domain, we compare the effect of two data selection schemes on the quality of the responses generated, and show the superiority of selection via a dedicated rhyme scheme detector that is also acquired through unsupervised learning. We also propose two strategies to mitigate the effect of disfluencies in the data which are common in the domain of hip hop lyrics, on the performance of our model. Despite the particularly noisy and unstructured nature of the domain, our model produces fluent and rhyming responses compared to a standard phrase based SMT baseline in human evaluations.

Even though the informal language of spoken text and web forum genres presents great difficulties for automatic semantic role labeling, we show that surprisingly, tuning statistical machine translation against the SRL-based objective function, MEANT, nevertheless leads more robustly to adequate translations of these informal genres than tuning against BLEU or TER. The accuracy of automatic semantic parsing has been shown to degrade significantly on informal genres such as speech or tweets, compared to formal genres like newswire. In spite of this, human evaluators preferred translations from MEANT-tuned systems over the BLEU- or TER-tuned ones by a significant margin. Error analysis indicates that one of the major sources of errors in automatic shallow semantic parsing of informal genres is failure to identify the semantic frame for copula or existential senses of ``be''. We show that MEANT's correlation with human adequacy judgment on informal text is improved by reconstructing the missing semantic frames for ``be''. Our tuning approach is independent of the translation model architecture, so any SMT model can potentially benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated through our approach.

"Improving machine translation by training against an automatic semantic frame based evaluation metric". 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2013), 375-381. Sofia, Bulgaria: Jul 2013. We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation. Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferred MEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire---even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language. We argue that by preserving the meaning of the translations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules. As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate. Training a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function is independent of the translation model paradigm, so, any translation model can benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated through our approach. In this paper, we show for the first time that tuning an MT system against MEANT significantly improves translation adequacy on formal, as well as informal text compared to tuning against BLEU or TER.

Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra 2013), at ACL 2013, 67-73. Sofia, Bulgaria: Jul 2013. We present a minimalist, unsupervised learning model that induces relatively clean phrasal inversion transduction grammars by employing the minimum description length principle to drive search over a space defined by two opposing extreme types of ITGs. In comparison to most current SMT approaches, the model learns a very parsimonious phrase translation lexicons that provide an obvious basis for generalization to abstract translation schemas. To do this, the model maintains internal consistency by avoiding use of mismatched or unrelated models, such as word alignments or probabilities from IBM models. The model introduces a novel strategy for avoiding the pitfalls of premature pruning in chunking approaches, by incrementally splitting an ITG while using a second ITG to guide this search.

Sofia, Bulgaria: Jul 2013. The linguistically transparent MEANT and UMEANT metrics are tunable, simple yet highly effective, fully automatic approximation to the human HMEANT MT evaluation metric which measures semantic frame similarity between MT output and reference translations. In this paper, we describe HKUST's submission to the WMT 2013 metrics evaluation task, MEANT and UMEANT. MEANT is optimized by tuning a small number of weights—one for each semantic role label—so as to maximize correlation with human adequacy judgment on a development set. UMEANT is an unsupervised version where weights for each semantic role label are estimated via an inexpensive unsupervised approach, as opposed to MEANT's supervised method relying on more expensive grid search. In this paper, we present a battery of experiments for optimizing MEANT on different development sets to determine the set of weights that maximize MEANT's accuracy and stability. Evaluated on test sets from the WMT 2012/2011 metrics evaluation, both MEANT and UMEANT achieve competitive correlations with human judgments using nothing more than a monolingual corpus and an automatic shallow semantic parser.

In Adrian-Horia DEDIU, Carlos MARTÍN-VIDE, Ruslan MITKOV, and Bianca TRUTHE (editors), First International Conference on Statistical Language and Speech Processing (SLSP 2013), 39-50. Tarragona, Spain: Jul 2013. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 7978, 2013. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. We attack a woefully under-explored language genre—lyrics in music—introducing a novel hidden Markov model based method for completely unsupervised identification of rhyme schemes in hip hop lyrics, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first such effort. Unlike previous approaches that use supervised or semi-supervised approaches for the task of rhyme scheme identification, our model does not assume any prior phonetic or labeling information whatsoever. Also, unlike previous work on rhyme scheme identification, we attack the difficult task of hip hop lyrics in which the data is more highly unstructured and noisy. A novel feature of our approach comes from the fact that we do not manually segment the verses in lyrics according to any pre-specified rhyme scheme, but instead use a number of hidden states of varying rhyme scheme lengths to automatically impose a soft segmentation. In spite of the level of difficulty of the challenge, we nevertheless were able to obtain a surprisingly high precision of 35.81\% and recall of 57.25\% on the task of identifying the rhyming words, giving a total f-score of 44.06\%. These encouraging results were obtained in the face of highly noisy data, lack of clear stanza segmentation, and a very wide variety of rhyme schemes used in hip hop.

In Adrian-Horia DEDIU, Carlos MARTÍN-VIDE, Ruslan MITKOV, and Bianca TRUTHE (editors), First International Conference on Statistical Language and Speech Processing (SLSP 2013), 224-235. Tarragona, Spain: Jul 2013. Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 7978, 2013. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag. We argue that for purely incremental unsupervised learning of phrasal inversion transduction grammars, a minimum description length driven, iterative top-down rule segmentation approach that is the polar opposite of our previous bottom-up iterative rule chunking mode yields significantly better translation accuracy and grammar parsimony. We still aim for unsupervised bilingual grammar induction such that training and testing are optimized upon the same exact underlying model—a basic principle of machine learning and statistical prediction that has become unduly ignored in statistical machine translation models of late, where most decoders are badly mismatched to the training assumptions. Our novel approach learns phrasal translations by recursively subsegmenting the training corpus, as opposed to our previous model—where we start with a token-based transduction grammar and iteratively build larger chunks. Moreover, the rule segmentation decisions in our approach are driven by a minimum description length objective, whereas the rule chunking decisions were driven by a maximum likelihood objective. We demonstrate empirically how this trades off maximum likelihood against model size, aiming for a more parsimonious grammar that escapes the perfect overfitting to the training data that we start out with, and gradually generalizes to previously unseen sentence translations so long as the model shrinks enough to warrant a looser fit to the training data. Experimental results show that our approach produces a significantly smaller and better model than the chunking-based approach. Markus SAERS, Karteek ADDANKI, and Dekai WU. "Combining Top-down and Bottom-up Search for Unsupervised Induction of Transduction Grammars". Proceedings of SSST-7, Seventh Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (at NAACL HLT 2013), 48-57. Atlanta: Jun 2013. We show that combining both bottom-up rule chunking and top-down rule segmentation search strategies in purely unsupervised learning of phrasal inversion transduction grammars yields significantly better translation accuracy than either strategy alone. Previous approaches have relied only on one search strategy or the other, such as the bottom-up iterative rule chunking approach of Saers et al. (2012). The key property that lets us combine the bottom-up work of Saers et al. with our opposing iterative top-down rule segmentation strategy so effortlessly is that they also stay strictly within a pure transduction grammar framework; the integration of their efforts into our own work is therefore completely seamless. Both their approach and ours share a common aim of unsupervised bilingual grammar induction under matching models during both training and testing---instead of decoding under a completely different model architecture than what is assumed during the training phases, which violates an elementary principle of machine learning and statistics. But whereas Saers et al.'s model only incrementally builds longer transduction rules by chunking smaller transduction rules bottom-up, we introduce a complementary top-down model that incrementally builds shorter transduction rules by segmenting larger transduction rules top-down, driven by a minimum description length objective that trades off maximum likelihood against model size. We show empirically that combining the more liberal rule chunking model of Saers et al. with our more conservative rule segmentation model results in significantly better translations than either strategy in isolation.

"From Finite-State to Inversion Transductions: Toward Unsupervised Bilingual Grammar Induction". 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling-2012), 2325-2340. Mumbai: Dec 2012. We report a wide range of comparative experiments establishing for the first time contrastive foundations for a completely unsupervised approach to bilingual grammar induction that is cognitively oriented toward early category formation and phrasal chunking in the bootstrapping process up the expressiveness hierarchy from finite-state to linear to inversion transduction grammars. We show a consistent improvement in terms of cross-entropy throughout the bootstrapping process, as well as promising decoding experiments using the learned grammars. Rather than relying on external resources such as parses, POS tags or dictionaries, our method is fully unsupervised (in the way this term is typically understood in the machine translation community). This means that the bootstrapping can only rely on information gathered during the previous step, which necessitates some strategy for expanding the expressiveness of the grammars. We present principled approaches for moving from finite-state to linear transduction grammars as well as from linear to inversion transduction grammars. It is our belief that early, integrated category formation and phrasal chunking in this unsupervised bootstrapping process is better aligned to child language acquisition. Finally, we also report exploratory decoding results using some of the learned grammars. This is the first step towards an end-to-end grammar-based statistical machine translation system.

"Accuracy and robustness in measuring the lexical similarity of semantic role ﬁllers for automatic semantic MT evaluation". 26th Paciﬁc Asia Conference on Language,Information and Computation (PACLIC-26), 574-581. Bali: Nov 2012. We present larger-scale evidence overturning previous results, showing that among the many alternative phrasal lexical similarity measures based on word vectors, the Jaccard coefficient most increases the robustness of MEANT, the recently introduced, fully-automatic, state-of-the-art semantic MT evaluation metric. MEANT critically depends on phrasal lexical similarity scores in order to automatically determine which semantic role fillers should be aligned between reference and machine translations. The robustness experiments were conducted across various data sets following NIST MetricsMaTr protocols, showing higher Kendall correlation with human adequacy judgments against BLEU, METEOR (with and without synsets), WER, PER, TER and CDER. The Jaccard coefficient is shown to be more discriminative and robust than cosine similarity, the Min/Max metric with mutual information, Jensen Shannon divergence, or the Dice's coefficient. We also show that with Jaccard coefficient as the phrasal lexical similarity metric, individual word token scores are best aggregated into phrasal segment similarity scores using the geometric mean, rather than either the arithmetic mean or competitive linking style word alignments. Furthermore, we show empirically that a context window size of 5 captures the optimal amount of information for training the word vectors. The combined results suggest a new formulation of MEANT with significantly improved robustness across data sets. Chi-kiu LO and Dekai WU. "Unsupervised vs. supervised weight estimation for semantic MT evaluation metrics". Proceedings of SSST-6, Sixth Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (at ACL 2012). Jeju, South Korea: Jul 2012. We present an unsupervised approach to estimate the appropriate degree of contribution of each semantic role type for semantic translation evaluation, yielding a semantic MT evaluation metric whose correlation with human adequacy judgments is comparable to that of recent supervised approaches but without the high cost of a human-ranked training corpus. Our new unsupervised estimation approach is motivated by an analysis showing that the weights learned from supervised training are distributed in a similar fashion to the relative frequencies of the semantic roles. Empirical results show that even without a training corpus of human adequacy rankings against which to optimize correlation, using instead our relative frequency weighting scheme to approximate the importance of each semantic role type leads to a semantic MT evaluation metric that correlates comparable with human adequacy judgments to previous metrics that require far more expensive human rankings of adequacy over a training corpus. As a result, the cost of semantic MT evaluation is greatly reduced. Ondřej BOJAR and Dekai WU. "Towards a Predicate-Argument Evaluation for MT". Proceedings of SSST-6, Sixth Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (at ACL 2012). Jeju, South Korea: Jul 2012. HMEANT (Lo and Wu, 2011a) is a manual MT evaluation technique that focuses on predicate-argument structure of the sentence. We relate HMEANT to an established linguistic theory, highlighting the possibilities of reusing existing knowledge and resources for interpreting and automating HMEANT. We apply HMEANT to a new language, Czech in particular, by evaluating a set of English- to-Czech MT systems. HMEANT proves to correlate with manual rankings at the sentence level better than a range of automatic metrics. However, the main contribution of this paper is the identification of several issues of HMEANT annotation and our proposal on how to resolve them. Chi-kiu LO, Anand Karthik TUMULURU and Dekai WU. "Fully Automatic Semantic MT Evaluation". 7th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (at NAACL 2012). Montreal: Jun 2012. We introduce the first fully automatic, fully semantic frame based MT evaluation metric, MEANT, that outperforms all other commonly used automatic metrics in correlating with human judgment on translation adequacy. Recent work on HMEANT, which is a human metric, indicates that machine translation can be better evaluated via semantic frames than other evaluation paradigms, requiring only minimal effort from monolingual humans to annotate and align semantic frames in the reference and machine translations. We propose a surprisingly effective Occam's razor automation of HMEANT that combines standard shallow semantic parsing with a simple maximum weighted bipartite matching algorithm for aligning semantic frames. The matching criterion is based on lexical similarity scoring of the semantic role fillers through a simple context vector model which can readily be trained using any publicly available large monolingual corpus. Sentence level correlation analysis, following standard NIST MetricsMATR protocol, shows that this fully automated version of HMEANT achieves significantly higher Kendall correlation with human adequacy judgments than BLEU, NIST, METEOR, PER, CDER, WER, or TER. Furthermore, we demonstrate that performing the semantic frame alignment automatically actually tends to be just as good as performing it manually. Despite its high performance, fully automated MEANT is still able to preserve HMEANT's virtues of simplicity, representational transparency, and inexpensiveness.

"LTG vs. ITG Coverage of Cross-Lingual Verb Frame Alternations". 16th Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT-2012). Trento, Italy: May 2012. We show in an empirical study that not only did all cross-lingual alternations of verb frames across Chinese–English translations fall within the reordering capacity of Inversion Transduction Grammars, but more surprisingly, about 97% of the alternations were expressible by the far more restrictive Linear Transduction Grammars. Also, about 71% of the cross-lingual verb frame alternations turn out to be monotonic even for diverse language pairs such as Chinese–English. We also observe that a source verb frame alternation pattern translates into a small subset of the possible target verb frame alternation patterns, based on the construction of the source sentence and the frame set definitions. As a part of our evaluation, we also present a novel linear time algorithm to determine whether a particular syntactic alignment falls within the expressiveness of Linear Transduction Grammars. To our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to analyze the cross-lingual alternation behavior of semantic frames and the extent of their coverage under syntax-based machine translation formalisms.

"Mining Parallel Documents Using Low Bandwidth and High Precision CLIR from the Heterogeneous Web". 5th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP 2011). Chiang Mai, Thailand: Nov 2011. We propose a content-based approach to mine parallel resources from the entire web using cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) with search query relevance score (SQRS). Our method improves mining recall by going beyond URL matching to find parallel documents from non-parallel sites. We introduce SQRS to improve the precision of mining. Our method makes use of search engines to query for target document given each source document and therefore does not require downloading target language documents in batch mode, reducing computational cost on the local machines and bandwidth consumption. We obtained a very high mining precision (88%) on the parallel documents by the pure CLIR approach. After extracting parallel sentences from the mined documents and using them to train an SMT system, we found that the SMT performance, with 29.88 BLEU score, is comparable to that obtained with high quality manually translated parallel sentences with 29.54 BLEU score, illustrating the excellent quality of the mined parallel material.

We investigate the formal expressivity properties of linear transductions, the class of transductions generated by linear transduction grammars, linear inversion transduction grammars and preterminalized linear inversion transduction grammars. While empirical results such as those in previous work are of course an ultimate test of modeling adequacy for machine translation applications, it is equally important to understand the formal theoretical properties of any such new representation. An important part of the expressivity of a transduction is the possibility to align tokens between the two languages generated. We refer to the number of different alignments that are allowed under a transduction as its weak alignment capacity. This aspect of expressivity is quantified for linear transductions using preterminalized linear inversion transduction grammars, and compared to the expressivity of finite-state transductions, inversion transductions and syntax-directed transductions. Markus SAERS and Dekai WU. "Linear Transduction Grammars and Zipper Finite-State Transducers". Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2011). Hissar, Bulgaria: Sep 2011. We examine how the recently explored class of linear transductions relates to finite-state models. Historically neglected, linear transductions are gaining interest in statistical machine translation modeling, due to recent empirical studies demonstrating that their attractive balance of generative capacity and complexity characteristics lead to improved accuracy and speed in learning alignment and translation models. Such work has until now characterized the class of linear transductions in terms of either (a) linear inversion transduction grammars (LITGs) which are linearized restrictions of inversion transduction grammars or (b) linear transduction grammars (LTGs) which are bilingualized generalizations of linear grammars. In this paper, we offer a new alternative characterization of linear transductions, as relating four finite-state languages to each other. In other words, linear transductions are finite-state in four dimensions. We introduce the devices of zipper finite-state automata (ZFSAs) and zipper finite-state transducers (ZFSTs) in order to construct the bridge between linear transductions and finite-state models.

"Speech Translation with Grammar Driven Probabilistic Phrasal Bilexica Extraction". 12th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association (Interspeech 2011). Florence, Italy: Aug 2011. We introduce a new type of transduction grammar that allows for learning of probabilistic phrasal bilexica, leading to a significant improvement in spoken language translation accuracy. The current state-of-the-art in statistical machine translation relies on a complicated and crude pipeline to learn probabilistic phrasal bilexica---the very core of any speech translation system. In this paper, we present a more principled approach to learning probabilistic phrasal bilexica, based on stochastic transduction grammar learning applicable to speech corpora.

We argue for an alternative paradigm in evaluating machine translation quality that is strongly empirical but more accurately reflects the utility of translations, by returning to a representational foundation based on AI oriented lexical semantics, rather than the superficial flat n-gram and string representations recently dominating the field. Driven by such metrics as BLEU and WER, current SMT frequently produces unusable translations where the semantic event structure is mistranslated: who did what to whom, when, where, why, and how? We argue that it is time for a new generation of more “intelligent'' automatic and semi-automatic metrics, based clearly on getting the structure right at the lexical semantics level. We show empirically that it is possible to use simple PropBank style semantic frame representations to surpass all currently widespread metrics' correlation to human adequacy judgments, including even HTER. We also show that replacing human annotators with automatic semantic role labeling still yields much of the advantage of the approach. We combine the best of both worlds: from an SMT perspective, we provide superior yet low-cost quantitative objective functions for translation quality; and yet from an AI perspective, we regain the representational transparency and clear reflection of semantic utility of structural frame-based knowledge representations.

"MEANT: An inexpensive, high-accuracy, semi-automatic metric for evaluating translation utility via semantic frames". 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (ACL HLT 2011). Portland, Oregon: Jun 2011. We introduce a novel semi-automated metric, MEANT, that assesses translation utility by matching semantic role fillers, producing scores that correlate with human judgment as well as HTER but at much lower labor cost. As machine translation systems improve in lexical choice and fluency, the shortcomings of widespread n-gram based, fluency-oriented MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which fail to properly evaluate adequacy, become more apparent. But more accurate, non-automatic adequacy-oriented MT evaluation metrics like HTER are highly labor-intensive, which bottlenecks the evaluation cycle. We first show that when using untrained monolingual readers to annotate semantic roles in MT output, the non-automatic version of the metric HMEANT achieves a 0.43 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgments at the sentence level, far superior to BLEU at only 0.20, and equal to the far more expensive HTER. We then replace the human semantic role annotators with automatic shallow semantic parsing to further automate the evaluation metric, and show that even the semi-automated evaluation metric achieves a 0.34 correlation coefficient with human adequacy judgment, which is still about 80% as closely correlated as HTER despite an even lower labor cost for the evaluation procedure. The results show that our proposed metric is significantly better correlated with human judgment on adequacy than current widespread automatic evaluation metrics, while being much more cost effective than HTER.

Proceedings of SSST-5, Fifth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (at ACL 2011). Portland, Oregon: Jun 2011. We show that reifying the rules from hyperedge weights to first-class graph nodes automatically gives us rule expectations in any kind of grammar expressible as a deductive system, without any explicit algorithm for calculating rule expectations (such as the inside-outside algorithm). This gives us expectation maximization training for any grammar class with a parsing algorithm that can be stated as a deductive system, for free. Having such a framework in place accelerates turn-over time for experimenting with new grammar classes and parsing algorithms---to implement a grammar learner, only the parse forest construction has to be implemented. Chi-kiu LO and Dekai WU. "Structured vs. Flat Semantic Role Representations for Machine Translation Evaluation". Proceedings of SSST-5, Fifth Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure in Statistical Translation (at ACL 2011). Portland, Oregon: Jun 2011. We argue that failing to capture the degree of contribution of each semantic frame in a sentence explains puzzling results in recent work on the MEANT family of semantic MT evaluation metrics, which have disturbingly indicated that dissociating semantic roles and fillers from their predicates actually improves correlation with human adequacy judgments even though, intuitively, properly segregating event frames should more accurately reflect the preservation of meaning. Our analysis finds that both properly structured and flattened representations fail to adequately account for the contribution of each semantic frame to the overall sentence. We then show that the correlation of HMEANT, the human variant of MEANT, can be greatly improved by introducing a simple length-based weighting scheme that approximates the degree of contribution of each semantic frame to the overall sentence. The new results also show that, without flattening the structure of semantic frames, weighting the degree of each frame's contribution gives HMEANT higher correlations than the previously best-performing flattened model, as well as HTER. Markus SAERS and Dekai WU. "Principled Induction of Phrasal Bilexica". 15th Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT-2011). Leuven, Belgium: May 2011. We aim to replace the long and complicated, pipeline employed to produce probabilistic phrasal bilexica with a theoretically principled, grammar based, approach. To this end, we introduce a phrasal generalization of linear transduction grammars (LTGs), and an iterative induction method that works on raw corpora. Surface-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems rely heavily on capturing the immediate context of words to be able to translate them accurately. It would be desirable to bring this power into structured SMT systems, but this is far from a trivial problem. Our immediate aim is to build a probabilistic bilexicon, which means that we would like to have a grammar where the entries constitute a natural probability distribution. Since this is not easily achievable with LTGs or linear inversion transduction grammars (LITGs), we introduce the class of preterminalized LITGs, which are equivalent to both LTGs and LITGs in terms of generative capacity, and which have the desired property of separating the lexical rules into one category whose probability distribution maps naturally to the bilexicon's. As a proof of concept, we show that phrasal bilexica, induced in this manner, can be used to improve the performance of a traditional phrase-based SMT system. Dekai WU. Alignment. In Nitin INDURKHYA and Fred DAMERAU (editors), CRC Handbook of Natural Language Processing, Second Edition. 367-408. CRC Press. 2010. In this chapter we discuss the work done on automatic alignment of parallel texts for various purposes. Fundamentally, an alignment algorithm accepts as input a bitext, and produces as output a bisegmentation relation that identifies corresponding segments between the texts. Bitext alignment fundamentally lies at the heart of all data-driven machine translation methods, and the rapid research progress on alignment since 1990 reflects the advent of statistical machine translation (SMT) and example-based machine translation (EBMT) approaches. Yet the importance of alignment extends as well to many other practical applications for translators, bilingual lexicographers, and even ordinary readers. A wide variety of techniques now exist, ranging from the most simple (counting characters or words) to the more sophisticated, sometimes involving linguistic data (lexicons) which may or may not have been automatically induced themselves. Techniques have been developed for aligning passages of various granularities: documents, paragraphs, sentences, constituents, collocations or phrases, words, and characters. Some techniques work on precisely translated parallel corpora, while others work on noisy, comparable, or non-parallel corpora. Some techniques make use of apparent morphological features, while others rely on cognates and loan-words; of particular interest is work done on languages which do not have a common writing system. Some techniques align only shallow, flat chunks, while others align compositional, hierarchical structures. The robustness and generality of different techniques has generated much discussion.

In Joseph Olive, Caitlin Christianson, and John McCary (editors), Handbook of Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation: DARPA Global Autonomous Language Exploitation. Springer. 2010. We present efforts toward moving statistical machine translation toward incorporating semantic modeling. The most glaring types of errors made by current systems appear to be prime targets for lexical semantics models, which have heretofore been largely absent from statistical machine translation models. Although sense disambiguation and semantic roles both appear highly relevant to translation accuracy, experience suggests that simply dropping in the existing models is unlikely to improve translation accuracy; rather, adaptations will be necessary. We discuss (1) a new Phrase Sense Disambiguation model that successfully improves statistical phrase-based translation for the first time by making three critical adaptations to traditional word sense disambiguation configurations, and (2) a series of empirical studies that illuminate more precisely the likely contribution of semantic roles in improving statistical machine translation accuracy.

Proceedings of SSST-4, Fourth Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (at COLING 2010). Beijing: Aug 2010. We present two contributions to grammar driven translation. First, since both Inversion Transduction Grammar and Linear Inversion Transduction Grammars have been shown to produce better alignments then the standard word alignment tool, we investigate how the trade-off between speed and end-to-end translation quality extends to the choice of grammar formalism. Second, we prove that Linear Transduction Grammars (LTGs) generate the same transductions as Linear Inversion Transduction Grammars, and present a scheme for arriving at LTGs by bilingualizing Linear Grammars. We also present a method for obtaining Inversion Transduction Grammars from Linear (Inversion) Transduction Grammars, which can speed up grammar induction from parallel corpora dramatically.

Proceedings of SSST-4, Fourth Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (at COLING 2010). Beijing: Aug 2010. We present results of an empirical study on evaluating the utility of the machine translation output, by assessing the accuracy with which human readers are able to complete the semantic role annotation templates. Unlike the widely-used lexical and n-gram based or syntactic based MT evaluation metrics which are fluency-oriented, our results show that using semantic role labels to evaluate the utility of MT output achieve higher correlation with human judgments on adequacy. In this study, human readers were employed to identify the semantic role labels in the translation. For each role, the filler is considered an accurate translation if it expresses the same meaning as that annotated in the gold standard reference translation. Our SRL based f-score evaluation metric has a 0.41 correlation coefficient with the human judgement on adequacy, while in contrast BLEU has only a 0.25 correlation coefficient and the syntactic based MT evaluation metric STM has only 0.32 correlation coefficient with the human judgement on adequacy. Our results strongly indicate that using semantic role labels for MT evaluation can be significantly more effective and better correlated with human judgement on adequacy than BLEU and STM.

"Word Alignment with Stochastic Bracketing Linear Inversion Transduction Grammar". Human Language Technologies: The 2010 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL HLT 2010). Los Angeles: Jun 2010. The class of Linear Inversion Transduction Grammars (LITGs) is briefly introduced, and used to induce a word alignment over a parallel corpus. We show that alignment via Stochastic Bracketing LITGs is considerably faster than Stochastic Bracketing ITGs, while yielding alignments superior to the widely-used heuristic of intersecting bidirectional IBM alignments. Performance is measured as the translation quality of a phrase-based machine translation system built upon the word alignments. Chi-kiu LO and Dekai WU. "Evaluating Machine Translation Utility via Semantic Role Labels". Seventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2010). Malta: May 2010. We present the methodology that underlies new metrics for semantic machine translation evaluation that we are developing. Unlike widely-used lexical and n-gram based MT evaluation metrics, the aim of semantic MT evaluation is to measure the utility of translations. We discuss the design of empirical studies to evaluate the utility of machine translation output by assessing the accuracy for key semantic roles. Such roles can be annotated using Propbank-style PRED and ARG labels. Recent work by Wu and Fung (2009) introduced methods based on automatic semantic role labeling into statistical machine translation, to enhance the quality of MT output. However, semantic SMT approaches have so far still only been evaluated using lexical and n-gram based SMT evaluation metrics such as BLEU, which are not aimed at evaluating the utility of MT output. Direct data analysis is still needed to understand how semantic models can be leveraged to evaluate the utility of MT output. In this paper, we discuss a new methodology for evaluating the utility of the machine translation output, by assessing the accuracy with which human readers are able to match the Propbank annotation frames. Dekai WU. "Toward Machine Translation with Statistics and Syntax and Semantics". IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2009). Merano, Italy: Dec 2009. In this paper, we survey some central issues in the historical, current, and future landscape of statistical machine translation (SMT) research, taking as a starting point an extended three-dimensional MT model space. We posit a socio-geographical conceptual disparity hypothesis, that aims to explain why language pairs like Chinese-English have presented MT with so much more difficulty than others. The evolution from simple token-based to segment-based to tree-based syntactic SMT is sketched. For tree-based SMT, we consider language bias rationales for selecting the degree of compositional power within the hierarchy of expressiveness for transduction grammars (or synchronous grammars). This leads us to inversion transductions and the ITG model prevalent in current state-of-the-art SMT, along with the underlying ITG hypothesis, which posits a language universal. Against this backdrop, we enumerate a set of key open questions for syntactic SMT. We then consider the more recent area of semantic SMT. We list principles for successful application of sense disambiguation models to semantic SMT, and describe early directions in the use of semantic role labeling for semantic SMT.

"Empirical lower bounds on translation unit error rate for the full class of inversion transduction grammars". 11th International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT'09). Paris: Oct 2009. 33-36. Empirical lower bounds studies in which the frequency of alignment configurations that cannot be induced by a particular formalism is estimated, have been important for the developmenet of syntax-based machine translation formalisms. The formalism that has received most attention has been inversion transduction grammars (ITGs) (Wu, 1997). All previous work on the coverage of ITGs, however, concerns parse failure rates (PFRs) or sentence level coverage, which is not directly related to any of the evaluation measures used in machine translation. Søgaard and Kuhn (2009) induce lower bounds on translation unit error rates (TUERs) for a number of formalisms, incl. normal form ITGs, but not for the full class of ITGs. Many of the alignment configurations that cannot be induced by normal form ITGs can be induced by unrestricted ITGs, however. This paper estimates the difference and shows that the average reduction in lower bounds on TUER is 2.48 in absolute difference (16.01 in average parse failure rate).

"Learning Stochastic Bracketing Inversion Transduction Grammars with a Cubic Time Biparsing Algorithm". 11th International Conference on Parsing Technologies (IWPT'09). Paris: Oct 2009. 29-32. We present a biparsing algorithm for Stochastic Bracketing Inversion Transduction Grammars that runs in O(bn3) time instead of O(n6). Transduction grammars learned via an EM estimation procedure based on this biparsing algorithm are evaluated directly on the translation task, by building a phrase-based statistical MT system on top of the alignments dictated by Viterbi parses under the induced bigrammars. Translation quality at different levels of pruning are compared, showing improvements over a conventional word aligner even at heavy pruning levels. Anders SØGAARD and Dekai WU.

Proceedings of SSST-3, Third Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation. NAACL HLT 2009: Boulder, Colorado: Jun 2009. 28-36. We argue that learning word alignments through a compositionally-structured, joint process yields higher phrase-based translation accuracy than the conventional heuristic of intersecting conditional models. Flawed word alignments can lead to flawed phrase translations that damage translation accuracy. Yet the IBM word alignments usually used today are known to be flawed, in large part because IBM models (1) model reordering by allowing unrestricted movement of words, rather than constrained movement of compositional units, and therefore must (2) attempt to compensate via directed, asymmetric distortion and fertility models. The conventional heuristics for attempting to recover from the resulting alignment errors involve estimating two directed models in opposite directions and then intersecting their alignments – to make up for the fact that, in reality, word alignment is an inherently joint relation. A natural alternative is provided by Inversion Transduction Grammars, which estimate the joint word alignment relation directly, eliminating the need for any of the conventional heuristics. We show that this alignment ultimately produces superior translation accuracy on BLEU, NIST, and METEOR metrics over three distinct language pairs. Dekai WU and Pascale FUNG. "Semantic Roles for SMT: A Hybrid Two-Pass Model". Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL HLT 2009). Boulder, Colorado: Jun 2009. We present results on a novel hybrid semantic SMT model that incorporates the strengths of both semantic role labeling and phrase-based statistical machine translation. The approach avoids major complexity limitations via a two-pass architecture. The first pass is performed using a conventional phrase-based SMT model. The second pass is performed by a re-ordering strategy guided by shallow semantic parsers that produce both semantic frame and role labels. Evaluation on a Wall Street Journal newswire genre test set showed the hybrid model to yield an improvement of roughly half a point in BLEU score over a strong pure phrase-based SMT baseline – to our knowledge, the first successful application of semantic role labeling to SMT.

The experiments reported study several aspects key to success: (1) the frequencies of types of SMT errors where semantic parsing and role labeling could help, and (2) if and where semantic roles offer more accurate guidance to SMT than merely syntactic annotation, and (3) the potential quantitative impact of realistic semantic role guidance to SMT systems, in terms of BLEU and METEOR scores.

Sixth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-2008). Marrakech: May 2008. We present new direct data analysis showing that dynamically-built context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons are more useful resources for phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) than conventional static phrasal translation lexicons, which ignore all contextual information. After several years of surprising negative results, recent work suggests that context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons are an appropriate framework to successfully incorporate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) modeling into SMT. However, this approach has so far only been evaluated using automatic translation quality metrics, which are important, but aggregate many different factors. A direct analysis is still needed to understand how context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons impact translation quality, and whether the additional complexity they introduce is really necessary. In this paper, we focus on the impact of context-dependent translation lexicons on lexical choice in phrase-based SMT and show that context-dependent lexicons are more useful to a phrase-based SMT system than a conventional lexicon. A typical phrase-based SMT system makes use of more and longer phrases with context modeling, including phrases that were not seen very frequently in training. Even when the segmentation is identical, the context-dependent lexicons yields translations that match references more often than conventional lexicons. Dekai WU.

We focused on Chinese to English translation, but we also report results on the Arabic to English, Italian to English, and Japanese to English tasks. Marine CARPUAT and Dekai WU. "Context-Dependent Phrasal Translation Lexicons for Statistical Machine Translation". Machine Translation Summit XI. Copenhagen: Sep 2007. Most current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems make very little use of contextual information to select a translation candidate for a given input language phrase. However, despite evidence that rich context features are useful in stand-alone translation disambiguation tasks, recent studies reported that incorporating context-rich approaches from Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods directly into classic word-based SMT systems, surprisingly, did not yield the expected improvements in translation quality. We argue here that, instead, it is necessary to design a context-dependent lexicon that is specifically matched to a given phrase-based SMT model, rather than simply incorporating an independently built and tested WSD module. In this approach, the baseline SMT phrasal lexicon, which uses translation probabilities that are independent of context, is augmented with a context-dependent score, defined using insights from standalone translation disambiguation evaluations. This approach reliably improves performance on both IWSLT and NIST Chinese-English test sets, producing consistent gains on all eight of the most commonly used automated evaluation metrics. We analyze the behavior of the model along a number of dimensons, including an analysis confirming that the most important context features are not available in conventional phrase-based SMT models.

"How Phrase Sense Disambiguation outperforms Word Sense Disambiguation for Statistical Machine Translation". 11th Conference on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Machine Translation (TMI 2007). Skövde, Sweden: Sep 2007. 43-52. We present comparative empirical evidence arguing that a generalized phrase sense disambiguation approach better improves statistical machine translation than ordinary word sense disambiguation, along with a data analysis suggesting the reasons for this. Standalone word sense disambiguation, as exemplified by the Senseval series of evaluations, typically defines the target of disambiguation as a single word. But in order to be useful in statistical machine translation, our studies indicate that word sense disambiguation should be redefined to move beyond the particular case of single word targets, and instead to generalize to multi-word phrase targets. We investigate how and why the phrase sense disambiguation approach---in contrast to recent efforts to apply traditional word sense disambiguation to SMT---is able to yield statistically significant yimprovements in translation quality even under large data conditions, and consistently improve SMT across both IWSLT and NIST Chinese-English text translation tasks. We discuss architectural issues raised by this change of perspective, and consider the new model architecture necessitated by the phrase sense disambiguation approach.

"Learning Bilingual Semantic Frames: Shallow Semantic Parsing vs. Semantic Role Projection". 11th Conference on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Machine Translation (TMI 2007). Skövde, Sweden: Sep 2007. 75-84. To explore the potential application of semantic roles in structural machine translation, we propose to study the automatic learning of English-Chinese bilingual predicate argument structure mapping. We describe ARG_ALIGN, a new model for learning bilingual semantic frames that employs monolingual Chinese and English semantic parsers to learn bilingual semantic role mappings with 72.45% F-score, given an unannotated parallel corpus. We show that, contrary to a common preconception, our ARG_ALIGN model is superior to a semantic role projection model, SYN_ALIGN, which reaches only a 46.63% F-score by assuming semantic parallelism in bilingual sentences. We present experimental data explaining that this is due to cross-lingual mismatches between argument structures in English and Chinese at 17.24% of the time. This suggests that, in any potential application to enhance machine translation with semantic structural mapping, it may be preferable to employ independent automatic semantic parsers on source and target languages, rather than assuming semantic role parallelism.

"Improving Statistical Machine Translation using Word Sense Disambiguation". 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL 2007). Prague: Jun 2007. 61-72. We show for the first time that incorporating the predictions of a word sense disambiguation system within a typical phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) model consistently improves translation quality across all three different IWSLT Chinese-English test sets, as well as producing statistically significant improvements on the larger NIST Chinese-English MT task---and moreover never hurts performance on any test set, according not only to BLEU but to all eight most commonly used automatic evaluation metrics. Recent work has challenged the assumption that word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems are useful for SMT. Yet SMT translation quality still obviously suffers from inaccurate lexical choice. In this paper, we address this problem by investigating a new strategy for integrating WSD into an SMT system, that performs fully phrasal multi-word disambiguation. Instead of directly incorporating a Senseval-style WSD system, we redefine the WSD task to match the exact same phrasal translation disambiguation task faced by phrase-based SMT systems. Our results provide the first known empirical evidence that lexical semantics are indeed useful for SMT, despite claims to the contrary. Dekai WU and David CHIANG (editors).

We offer a perspective on EBMT from a statistical MT standpoint, by developing a three-dimensional MT model space based on three pairs of definitions: (1) logical versus statistical MT, (2) schema-based versus example-based MT, and (3) lexical versus compositional MT. Within this space we consider the interplay of three key ideas in the evolution of transfer, example-based, and statistical approaches to machine translation. We depict how all translation models face these issues in one way or another, regardless of the school of thought, and suggest where the real questions for the future may lie.

IEEE/ACL 2006 Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2006). Aruba: Dec 2006. We present the first known direct measurement of word alignment coverage on an Arabic-English parallel corpus using inversion transduction grammar constraints. While direct measurements have been reported for several European and Asian languages, to date no results have been available for Arabic or any Semitic language despite much recent activity on Arabic-English spoken language and text translation. Many recent syntax based statistical MT models operate within the domain of ITG expressiveness, often for efficiency reasons, so it has become important to determine the extent to which the ITG constraint assumption holds. Our results on Arabic provide further evidence that ITG expressiveness appears largely sufficient for core MT models. Pascale FUNG, Zhaojun WU, Yongsheng YANG, and Dekai WU. "Automatic learning of Chinese-English semantic structure mapping". IEEE/ACL 2006 Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2006). Aruba: Dec 2006. We present twin results on Chinese semantic parsing, with application to English-Chinese cross-lingual verb frame acquisition. First, we describe two new state-of-the-art Chinese shallow semantic parsers leading to an F-score of 82.01 on simultaneous frame and argument boundary identification and labeling. Subsequently, we propose a model that applies the separate Chinese and English semantic parsers to learn cross-lingual semantic verb frame argument mappings with 89.3% accuracy. The only training data needed by this cross-lingual learning model is a pair of non-parallel monolingual Propbanks, plus an unannotated parallel corpus. We also present the first reported controlled comparison of maximum entropy and SVM approaches to shallow semantic parsing, using the Chinese data.

Third International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2006). Kyoto: Nov 2006. [slides] We describe a machine translation approach being designed at HKUST to integrate semantic processing into statistical machine translation, beginning with entity and word sense disambiguation. We show how integrating the semantic modules consistently improves translation quality across several data sets. We report results on five different IWSLT 2006 speech translation tasks, representing HKUST's first participation in the IWSLT spoken language translation evaluation campaign. We translated both read and spontaneous speech transcriptions from Chinese to English, achieving reasonable performance despite the fact that our system is essentially text-based and therefore not designed and tuned to tackle the challenges of speech translation. We also find that the system achieves reasonable results on a wide range of languages, by evaluating on read speech transcriptions from Arabic, Italian, and Japanese into English.

Fifth SIGHAN Workshop of the Special Interest Group for Chinese Language Processing (SIGHAN5) at COLING/ACL 2006. Sydney, Australia: Jul 2006. We report an experiment in which a high-performance boosting based NER model originally designed for multiple European languages is instead applied to the Chinese named entity recognition task of the third SIGHAN Chinese language processing bakeoff. Using a simple character-based model along with a set of features that are easily obtained from the Chinese input strings, the system described employs boosting, a promising and theoretically well-founded machine learning method to combine a set of weak classifiers together into a final system. Even though we did no other Chinese-specific tuning, and used only one-third of the MSRA and CityU corpora to train the system, reasonable results are obtained. Our evaluation results show that 75.07 and 80.51 overall F-measures were obtained on MSRA and CityU test sets respectively. Dekai WU and Ken Wing Kuen LEE. "A grammatical approach to understanding textual tables using two-dimensional SCFGs". 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (COLING/ACL 2006). Sydney, Australia: Jul 2006. We present an elegant and extensible model that is capable of providing semantic interpretations for an unusually wide range of textual tables in documents. Unlike the few existing table analysis models, which largely rely on relatively ad hoc heuristics, our linguistically-oriented approach is systematic and grammar based, which allows our model (1) to be concise and yet (2) recognize a wider range of data models than others, and (3) disambiguate to a significantly finer extent the underlying semantic interpretation of the table in terms of data models drawn from relation database theory. To accomplish this, the model introduces Viterbi parsing under two-dimensional stochastic CFGs. The cleaner grammatical approach facilitates not only greater coverage, but also grammar extension and maintenance, as well as a more direct and declarative link to semantic interpretation, for which we also introduce a new, cleaner data model. In disambiguation experiments on recognizing relevant data models of unseen web tables from different domains, a blind evaluation of the model showed 60% precision and 80% recall. Dekai WU.

Springer Online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11736790_17. Berlin: Springer. The PASCAL Challenge's textual entailment recognition (RTE) task presents intriguing opportunities to test various implications of the strong language universal constraint posited by Wu's (1995, 1997) Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) hypothesis. The ITG Hypothesis provides a strong inductive bias, and has been repeatedly shown empirically to yield both efficiency and accuracy gains for numerous language acquisition tasks. Since the RTE challenge abstracts over many tasks, it invites meaningful analysis of the ITG Hypothesis across tasks including information retrieval, comparable documents, reading comprehension, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, and paraphrase acquisition. We investigate two new models for the RTE problem that employ simple generic Bracketing ITGs. Experimental results show that, even in the absence of any thesaurus to accommodate lexical variation between the Text and the Hypothesis strings, surprisingly strong results for a number of the task subsets are obtainable from the Bracketing ITG's structure matching bias alone. Dekai WU and Pascale FUNG. "Inversion Transduction Grammar Constraints for Mining Parallel Sentences from Quasi-Comparable Corpora". Second International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-2005). Jeju, South Korea: Oct 2005. We present a new implication of Wu's (1997) Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) Hypothesis, on the problem of retrieving truly parallel sentence translations from large collections of highly non-parallel documents. Our approach leverages a strong language universal constraint posited by the ITG Hypothesis, that can serve as a strong inductive bias for various language learning problems, resulting in both efficiency and accuracy gains. The task we attack is highly practical since non-parallel multilingual data exists in far greater quantities than parallel corpora, but parallel sentences are a much more useful resource. Our aim here is to mine truly parallel sentences, as opposed to comparable sentence pairs or loose translations as in most previous work. The method we introduce exploits Bracketing ITGs to produce the first known results for this problem. Experiments show that it obtains large accuracy gains on this task compared to the expected performance of state-of-the-art models that were developed for the less stringent task of mining comparable sentence pairs.

Second International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-2005). Jeju, South Korea: Oct 2005. We present the first known empirical test of an increasingly common speculative claim, by evaluating a representative Chinese-to-English SMT model directly on word sense disambiguation performance, using standard WSD evaluation methodology and datasets from the Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task. Much effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated word sense disambiguation (WSD) models, in particular with the Senseval series of workshops. At the same time, the recent improvements in the BLEU scores of statistical machine translation (SMT) suggests that SMT models are good at predicting the right translation of the words in source language sentences. Surprisingly however, the WSD accuracy of SMT models has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated WSD models. We present controlled experiments showing the WSD accuracy of current typical SMT models to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated WSD models considered. This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current SMT models do have limitations in comparison with dedicated WSD models, and that SMT should benefit from the better predictions made by the WSD models. Marine CARPUAT and Dekai WU. "Word Sense Disambiguation vs. Statistical Machine Translation". 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL-2005). Ann Arbor, MI: Jun 2005. We directly investigate a subject of much recent debate: do word sense disambigation models help statistical machine translation quality? We present empirical results casting doubt on this common, but unproved, assumption. Using a state-of-the-art Chinese word sense disambiguation model to choose translation candidates for a typical IBM statistical MT system, we find that word sense disambiguation does not yield significantly better translation quality than the statistical machine translation system alone. Error analysis suggests several key factors behind this surprising finding, including inherent limitations of current statistical MT architectures. Dekai WU. "Recognizing Paraphrases and Textual Entailment using Inversion Transduction Grammars". ACL-2005 Workshop on Empirical Modeling of Semantic Equivalence and Entailment. Ann Arbor, MI: Jun 2005. We present first results using paraphrase as well as textual entailment data to test the language universal constraint posited by Wu's (1995, 1997) Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) hypothesis. In machine translation and alignment, the ITG Hypothesis provides a strong inductive bias, and has been shown empirically across numerous language pairs and corpora to yield both efficiency and accuracy gains for various language acquisition tasks. Monolingual paraphrase and textual entailment recognition datasets, however, potentially facilitate closer tests of certain aspects of the hypothesis than bilingual parallel corpora, which simultaneously exhibit many irrelevant dimensions of cross-lingual variation. We investigate this using simple generic Bracketing ITGs containing no language-specific linguistic knowledge. Experimental results on the MSR Paraphrase Corpus show that, even in the absence of any thesaurus to accommodate lexical variation between the paraphrases, an uninterpolated average precision of at least 76% is obtainable from the Bracketing ITG's structure matching bias alone. This is consistent with experimental results on the Pascal Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge Corpus, which show surpisingly strong results for a number of the task subsets. Dekai WU.

"A Grammar-Based Chinese to English Speech Translation System for Portable Devices". 8th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing (INTERSPEECH 2004 - ICSLP). Jeju, South Korea: Oct 2004. Portable devices such as PDA phones and smart phones are increasingly popular. Many of these devices already have voice dialing capability. The next step is to offer more powerful personal-assistant features such as speech translation. In this paper, we propose a system that can translate speech commands in Chinese into English, in real-time, on small, portable devices with limited memory and computational power. We address the various computational and platform issues of speech recognition and translation on portable devices. We propose fixed-point computation, discrete front-end speech features, bi-phone acoustic models, grammar-based speech decoding, and unambiguous inversion transduction grammars for transfer-based translation. As a result, our speech translation system requires only 500k memory and a 200MHz CPU. Dekai WU, Grace NGAI, and Marine CARPUAT. "Why Nitpicking Works: Evidence for Occam's Razor in Error Correctors". 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING-2004). Geneva: Aug 2004. Empirical experience and observations have shown us when powerful and highly tunable classifiers such as maximum entropy classifiers, boosting and SVMs are applied to language processing tasks, it is possible to achieve high accuracies, but eventually their performances all tend to plateau out at around the same point. To further improve performance, various error correction mechanisms have been developed, but in practice, most of them cannot be relied on to predictably improve performance on unseen data; indeed, depending upon the test set, they are as likely to degrade accuracy as to improve it. This problem is especially severe if the base classifier has already been finely tuned. In recent work, we introduced N-fold Templated Piped Correction, or NTPC (``nitpick''), an intriguing error corrector that is designed to work in these extreme operating conditions. Despite its simplicity, it consistently and robustly improves the accuracy of existing highly accurate base models. This paper investigates some of the more surprising claims made by NTPC, and presents experiments supporting an Occam's Razor argument that more complex models are damaging or unnecessary in practice.

"Semi-Supervised Training of a Kernel PCA-Based Model for Word Sense Disambiguation". 20th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING-2004). Geneva: Aug 2004. In this paper, we introduce a new semi-supervised learning model for word sense disambiguation based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), with experiments showing that it can further improve accuracy over supervised KPCA models that have achieved WSD accuracy superior to the best published individual models. Although empirical results with supervised KPCA models demonstrate significantly better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art achieved by either naive Bayes or maximum entropy models on Senseval-2 data, we identify specific sparse data conditions under which supervised KPCA models deteriorate to essentially a most-frequent-sense predictor. We discuss the potential of KPCA for leveraging unannotated data for partially-unsupervised training to address these issues, leading to a composite model that combines both the supervised and semi-supervised models.

Barcelona: Jul 2004. We introduce a new method for disambiguating word senses that exploits a nonlinear Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) technique to achieve accuracy superior to the best published individual models. We present empirical results demonstrating significantly better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art achieved by either naive Bayes or maximum entropy models, on Senseval-2 data. We also contrast against another type of kernel method, the support vector machine (SVM) model, and show that our KPCA-based model outperforms the SVM-based model. It is hoped that these highly encouraging first results on KPCA for natural language processing tasks will inspire further development of these directions. Dekai WU and Yihai SHEN. "An Efficient Algorithm to Induce Minimum Average Lookahead Grammars for Incremental LR Parsing". ACL-2004 Workshop on Incremental Parsing: Bringing Engineering and Cognition Together. Barcelona: Jul 2004. We define a new learning task, minimum average lookahead grammar induction, with strong potential implications for incremental parsing in NLP and cognitive models. Our thesis is that a suitable learning bias for grammar induction is to minimize the degree of lookahead required, on the underlying tenet that language evolution drove grammars to be efficiently parsable in incremental fashion. The input to the task is an unannotated corpus, plus a nondeterministic constraining grammar that serves as an abstract model of environmental constraints confirming or rejecting potential parses. The constraining grammar typically allows ambiguity and is itself poorly suited for an incremental parsing model, since it gives rise to a high degree of nondeterminism in parsing. The learning task, then, is to induce a deterministic LR(k) grammar under which it is possible to incrementally construct one of the correct parses for each sentence in the corpus, such that the average degree of lookahead needed to do so is minimized. This is a significantly more difficult optimization problem than merely compiling LR(k) grammars, since kis not specified in advance. Clearly, naive approaches to this optimization can easily be computationally infeasible. However, by making combined use of GLR ancestor tables and incremental LR table construction methods, we obtain an O(n3+2m) greedy approximation algorithm for this task that is quite efficient in practice.

Third International Workshop on the Evaluation of Systems for the Semantic Analysis of Text (Senseval-3). ACL-2004 Workshop. Barcelona: Jul 2004. The HKUST word sense disambiguation systems benefit from a new nonlinear Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) based disambiguation technique. We discuss and analyze results from the Senseval-3 English, Chinese, and Multilingual Lexical Sample data sets. Among an ensemble of four different kinds of voted models, the KPCA-based model, along with the maximum entropy model, outperforms the boosting model and naive Bayes model. Interestingly, while the KPCA-based model typically achieves close or better accuracy than the maximum entropy model, nevertheless a comparison of predicted classifications shows that it has a significantly different bias. This characteristic makes it an excellent voter, as confirmed by results showing that removing the KPCA-based model from the ensemble generally degrades performance.

Lisbon: May 2004. We introduce a conservative error correcting model, Stacked TBL, that is designed to improve the performance of even high-performing models like boosting, with little risk of accidentally degrading performance. Stacked TBL is particularly well suited for corpus-based natural language applications involving high-dimensional feature spaces, since it leverages the characteristics of the TBL paradigm that we appropriate. We consider here the task of automatically annonating named entities in text corpora. The task does pose a number of challenges for TBL, to which there are some simple yet effective solutions. We discuss the empirical behavior of Stacked TBL, and consider evidence that despite its simplicity, more complex and time-consuming variants are not generally required.

Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (HLT/NAACL-2004). Boston: May 2004. We present the first known result for named entity recognition (NER) in realistic large-vocabulary spoken Chinese. We establish this result by applying a maximum entropy model, currently the single best known approach for textual Chinese NER, to the recognition output of the BBN LVCSR system on Chinese Broadcast News utterances. Our results support the claim that transferring NER approaches from text to spoken language is a significantly more difficult task for Chinese than for English. We propose re-segmenting the ASR hypotheses as well as applying post-classification to improve the performance. Finally, we introduce a method of using n-best hypotheses that yields a small but nevertheless useful improvement NER accuracy. We use acoustic, phonetic, language model, NER and other scores as confidence measure. Experimental results show an average of 6.7% relative improvement in precision and 1.7% relative improvement in F-measure. Dekai WU, Grace NGAI, and Marine CARPUAT. "N-fold Templated Piped Correction". First International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP-2004). Hainan, China: Mar 2004. We describe a broadly-applicable conservative error correcting model, N-fold Templated Piped Correction (NTPC), that consistently improves the accuracy of existing high-accuracy base models. Under circumstances where most obvious approaches actually reduce accuracy more than they improve it, NTPC nevertheless comes with little risk of accidentally degrading performance. NTPC is particularly well suited for natural language applications involving high-dimensional feature spaces, such as bracketing and disambiguation tasks, since its easily customizable template-driven learner allows efficient search over the kind of complex feature combinations that have typically eluded the base models. We show empirically that NTPC yields small but consistent accuracy gains on top of even high-performing models like boosting. We also give evidence that the various extreme design parameters in NTPC are indeed necessary for the intended operating range, even though they diverge from usual practice. Dekai WU.

In Jean VERONIS (editor), Parallel Text Processing: Alignment and Use of Translation Corpora. Dordrecht: Kluwer. ISBN 0-7923-6546-1. Aug 2000. We introduce (1) a novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar formalism for bilingual language modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept of bilingual parsing with a variety of parallel corpus analysis applications. Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well-suited to model ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing.

In this chapter we discuss the work done on automatic alignment of parallel texts for various purposes. Fundamentally, an alignment algorithm accepts as input a bitext, and produces as output a map that identifies corresponding passages between the texts. A rapidly-growing body of research on bitext alignment, beginning around 1990, attests to the importance of alignment to translators, bilingual lexicographers, adaptive machine translation systems, and even ordinary readers. A wide variety of techniques now exist, ranging from the most simple (counting characters or words) to the more sophisticated, sometimes involving linguistic data (lexicons) which may or may not have been automatically induced themselves. Techniques have been developed for aligning passages of various granularities: paragraphs, sentences, constituents, collocations, and words. Some techniques make use of apparent morphological features. Others rely on cognates and loan-words. Of particular interest is work done on languages which do not have a common writing system. The robustness and generality of different techniques has generated much discussion. SUI Zhifang, ZHAO Jun, and Dekai WU. "An Information-Theory-Based Feature Type Analysis for the Modelling of Statistical Parsing". ACL-2000. Hong Kong: Oct 2000. The paper proposes an information-theory-based method for feature types analysis in probabilistic evaluation modelling for statistical parsing. The basic idea is that we use entropy and conditional entropy to measure whether a feature type grasps some of the information for syntactic structure prediction. Our experiment quantitatively analyzes several feature types' power for syntactic structure prediction and draws a series of interesting conclusions. Yanlei DIAO, Hongjun LU, and Dekai WU. "A comparative study of classification based personal e-mail filtering". Fourth Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2000): 408-419. Kyoto: Apr 2000. This paper addresses personal E-mail filtering by casting it in the framework of text classification. Modeled as semi-structured documents, E-mail messages consist of a set of fields with predefined semantics and a number of variable length free-text fields. While most work on classification either concentrates on structured data or free text, the work in this paper deals with both of them. To perform classification, a naive Bayesian classifier was designed and implemented, and a decision tree based classifier was implemented. The design considerations and implementation issues are discussed. Using a relatively large amount of real personal E-mail data, comprehensive comparative study was conducted using the two classifiers. The importance of different features is reported. Results of other issues related to building an effective personal E-mail classifier are presented and discussed. It is shown that both classifiers can perform filtering with reasonable accuracy. While the decision tree based classifier outperforms the Bayesian classifier when features and training size are selected optimally for both, a carefully designed naive Bayesian classifier is more robust.

Budapest: Sep 1999. This paper uses an information-based approach to conduct feature types selection for language modeling in a systematic manner. We describe a quantitative analysis of the information gain and the information redundancy for various combinations of feature types inspired by both dependency structure and bigram structure through analyzing an English treebank corpus and taking word prediction as the object. The experiments yield several conclusions on the predictive value of several feature types and feature types combinations for word prediction, which are expected to provide reliable reference for feature type selection in language modeling. Aboy WONG and Dekai WU. "Learning a lightweight robust deterministic parser". Sixth European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (EUROSPEECH'99). Budapest: Sep 1999. We describe a method for automatically learning a parser from labeled, bracketed corpora that results in a fast, robust, lightweight parser that is suitable for real-time dialog systems and similar applications. Unlike ordinary parsers, all grammatical knowledge is captured in the learned decision trees, so no explicit phrase-structure grammar is needed. Another characteristic of the architecture is robustness, since the input need not fit pre-specified productions. The runtime architecture is very slim and references two learned decision trees that allow the parser to operate in a "strictly deterministic" manner in Marcus' (1977) sense. Even without using specific lexical features, we have achieved respectable labeled bracket accuracies of about 81% precision and 82% recall. Processing speed is more than 500 words per CPU second. We keep the parameter space small (in comparison to other statistically learned parsers) by using only part-of-speech tags and constituent labels as features for learning the decision trees. Without any optimization, the decision trees consume only 6M of memory, making it possible to run on platforms with limited memory. The learning method is readily applicable to other languages. Preliminary experiments on a Chinese corpus (which contains about 3000 sentences from Chinese primary school text) have yielded results comparable to that for English. Vincent CHOW and Dekai WU. "On the use of right context in sense-disambiguating language models". Sixth European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (EUROSPEECH'99). Budapest: Sep 1999. We investigate the utility of right-context (look-ahead information) in incremental left-to-right language models with word sense disambiguation, and discover somewhat unexpectedly that using right-context in addition to left-context (history) may actually reduce accuracy. We describe a left-to-right incremental naive-Bayes sense disambiguator, and then experimentally evaluate three apparently well-motivated extensions to take into account right-context information. The results argue that the contribution of right-context is limited, and that using it would probably necessitate sacrificing pure left-to-right processing.

Sixth European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (EUROSPEECH'99). Budapest: Sep 1999. In this paper, a distance-related unit association maximum entropy (DUAME) language modeling is proposed. This approach can model an event (unit subsequence) using the co-occurrence of full distance unit association (UA) features so that it is able to pursue a functional approximation to higher order N-gram with significantly less memory requirement. A smoothing strategy related to this modeling will also be discussed. Preliminary experimental results have shown that DUAME modeling is comparable to conventional N-gram modeling in perplexity.

We present a new method to automatically merge lexicons that employ different incompatible POS categories. Such incompatibilities have hindered efforts to combine lexicons to maximize coverage with reasonable human effort. Given an "original lexicon", our method is able to merge lexemes from an "additional lexicon" into the original lexicon, converting lexemes from the additional lexicon with about 89% precision. This level of precision is achieved with the aid of a device we introduce called an anti-lexicon, which neatly summarizes all the essential information we need about the co-occurrence of tags and lemmas. Our model is intuitive, fast, easy to implement, and does not require heavy computational resources nor training corpus. Dekai WU, ZHAO Jun, and SUI Zhifang. "An information-theoretic empirical analysis of dependency-based feature types for word prediction models". Joint SIGDAT Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Very Large Corpora (EMNLP/VLC-99). Maryland: Jun 1999. Over the years, many proposals have been made to incorporate assorted types of feature in language models. However, discrepancies between training sets, evaluation criteria, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult to compare the models objectively. In this paper, we take an information theoretic approach to select feature types in a systematic manner. We describe a quantitative analysis of the information gain and the information redundancy for various combinations of feature types inspired by both dependency structure and bigram structure, using a Chinese treebank and taking word prediction as the object. The experiments yield several conclusions on the predictive value of several feature types and feature types combinations for word prediction, which are expected to provide guidelines for feature type selection in language modeling. Aboy WONG and Dekai WU. "Are phrase structured grammars useful in statistical parsing?". NLPRS 1999. Beijing: Nov 1999. In this paper, we argue: (1) To parse accurately, a grammar is not necessary. (2) It is possible to parse deterministically by not conforming to an explicit grammar. We support the above claims by presenting our parser, which is lightweight, grammar-less, deterministic and have the highest accuracy among tag based parsers. The speed of our parser is more than 500 words per CPU second and only 6M of memory is needed for loading the parsing model. In our architecture, the grammatical information is captured by the parsing model. Our parsing model differs from others in that, extra information about how to group constituents are provided. Thus an explicit grammar is not needed in our algorithm. Michael CARL and Dekai WU. "Inferring maximally invertible bi-grammars for example-based machine translation". NLPRS 1999. Beijing: Nov 1999. This paper discusses inference strategies of context-free bi-grammars for example based machine translation (EBMT). The EBMT system EDGAR is discussed in detail. The notion of invertible contextfree feature bi-grammar is introduced in order to provide a means to decide upon the degree of ambiguity of the inferred bi-grammar. It is claimed that a maximally invertible bi-grammar can enhance the precision of the bilingual alignment process, reduce the complexity of the inferred grammar, and uncover inconsistencies in bi-corpora. This paper describes preliminary reflections and thus no empirical evaluation of the method is provided. Dekai WU and Hongsing WONG. "Machine translation with a stochastic grammatical channel". COLING-ACL'98. Montreal: Aug 1998. We introduce a stochastic grammatical channel model for machine translation, that synthesizes several desirable characteristics of both statistical and grammatical machine translation. As with the pure statistical translation model described by Wu (1996) (in which a bracketing transduction grammar models the channel), alternative hypotheses compete probabilistically, exhaustive search of the translation hypothesis space can be performed in polynomial time, and robustness heuristics arise naturally from a language-independent inversion-transduction model. However, unlike pure statistical translation models, the generated output string is guaranteed to conform to a given target grammar. The model employs only (1) a translation lexicon, (2) a context-free grammar for the target language, and (3) a bigram language model. The fact that no explicit bilingual translation rules are used makes the model easily portable to a variety of source languages. Initial experiments show that it also achieves significant speed gains over our earlier model. Dekai WU. "A position statement on Chinese segmentation". Presented at the Chinese Language Processing Workshop, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Jul 1998. Dekai WU. "Stochastic inversion transduction grammars and bilingual parsing of parallel corpora". Computational Linguistics 23(3):377-404, Sep 1997. We introduce (1) a novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar formalism for bilingual language modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept of bilingual parsing with a variety of parallel corpus analysis applications. Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist. Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well-suited to model ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints. We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks such as segmentation, bracketing, phrasal alignment, and parsing.

"Structure and performance of a dependency language model". EUROSPEECH'97. Rhodes, Greece: Sep 1997. We present a maximum entropy language model that incorporates both syntax and semantics via a dependency grammar. Such a grammar expresses the relations between words by a directed graph. Because the edges of this graph may connect words that are arbitrarily far apart in a sentence, this technique can incorporate the predictive power of words that lie outside of bigram or trigram range. We have built several simple dependency models, as we call them, and tested them in a speech recognition experiment. We report experimental results for these models here, including one that has a small but statistically significant advantage (p < .02) over a bigram language model. Pascale FUNG, Bertram SHI, Dekai WU, LAM Wai Bun, and WONG Shuen Kong. "Dealing with multilinguality in a spoken language query translator". ACL/EACL-97 Workshop on Spoken Language Translation. Madrid: Jul 1997. Robustness is an important issue for multilingual speech interfaces for spoken language translation systems. We have studied three aspects of robustness in such a system: accent differences, mixed language input, and the use of common feature sets for HMM-based speech recognizers for English and Cantonese. The results of our preliminary experiments show that accent differences case recognizer performance to degrade. A rather surprising finding is that for mixed language input, a straightforward implementation of a mixed language model-based speech recognizer performs less well than the concatenation of pure language recognizers. Our experimental results also show that a common feature set, parameter set, and common algorithm lead to different performance output for Cantonese and English speech recognition modules. Dekai WU. "A polynomial-time algorithm for statistical machine translation". ACL-96: 34th Annual Meeting of the Assoc. for Computational Linguistics. Santa Cruz, CA: Jun. 1996. We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm for statistical machine translation. This algorithm can be used in place of the expensive, slow best-first search strategies in current statistical translation architectures. The approach employs the stochastic bracketing transduction grammar (SBTG) model we recently introduced to replace earlier word alignment channel models, while retaining a bigram language model. The new algorithm in our experience yields major speed improvement with no significant loss of accuracy. Xuanyin XIA and Dekai WU. "Parsing Chinese with an almost-context-free grammar". EMNLP-96, Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Philadelphia: May 1996. We describe a novel parsing strategy we are employing for Chinese. We believe progress in Chinese parsing technology has been slowed by the excessive ambiguity that typically arises in pure context-free grammars. This problem has inspired a modified formalism that enhances our ability to write and maintain robust large grammars, by constraining productions with left/right contexts and/or nonterminal functions. Parsing is somewhat more expensive than for pure context-free parsing, but is still efficient by both theoretical and empirical analyses. Encouraging experimental results with our current grammar are described. Dekai WU and Xuanyin XIA. "Large-scale automatic extraction of an English-Chinese lexicon". Machine Translation 9(3-4): 285-313. 1995. We report experimental results on automatic extraction of an English-Chinese translation lexicon, by statistical analysis of a large parallel corpus, using limited amounts of linguistic knowledge. To our knowledge, these are the first empirical results of the kind between an Indo-European and non-Indo-European language for any significant vocabulary and corpus size. The learned vocabulary size is about 6,500 English words, achieving translation precision in the 86-96% range, with alignment proceeding at paragraph, sentence, and word levels. Specifically, we report (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, (2) experiments supporting the usefulness of restricted lexical cues for statistical paragraph and sentence alignment, and (3) experiments that question the role of hand-derived monolingual lexicons for automatic word translation acquitision. Using a hand-derived monolingual lexicon, the learned translation lexicon averages 2.33 Chinese translations per English entry, with a manually-filtered precision of 95.1%, and an automatically-filtered weighted precision of 86.0%. We then introduce a fully automatic two-stage statistical methodology that is able to learn translations for collocations. A statistically-learned monolingual Chinese lexicon is first used to segment the Chinese text, before applying bilingual training to produce 6,429 English entries with 2.25 Chinese translations per entry. This method improves the manually-filtered precision to 96.0% and the automatically-filtered weighted precision to 91.0%, an error rate reduction of 35.7% from using a hand-derived monolingual lexicon.

Joint Conf. on Artificial Intelligence, 1328-1335. Montreal: Aug 1995. We introduce (1) a novel stochastic inversion transduction grammar formalism for bilingual language modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept of bilingual parsing with potential application to a variety of parallel corpus analysis problems. The formalism combines three tactics against the constraints that render finite-state transducers less useful: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm. A convenient normal form is shown to exist, and we discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars bring bilingual constraints to bear upon problematic corpus analysis tasks. Dekai WU. "An algorithm for simultaneously bracketing parallel texts by aligning words". ACL-95: 33rd Annual Meeting of the Assoc. for Computational Linguistics, 244-251. Cambridge, MA: Jun 1995. We describe a grammarless method for simultaneously bracketing both halves of a parallel text and giving word alignments, assuming only a translation lexicon for the language pair. We introduce inversion-invariant transduction grammars which serve as generative models for parallel bilingual sentences with weak order constraints. Focusing on transduction grammars for bracketing, we formulate a normal form, and a stochastic version amenable to a maximum-likelihood bracketing algorithm. Several extensions and experiments are discussed. Dekai WU. "Trainable coarse bilingual grammars for parallel text bracketing". WVLC-3: 3rd Annual Workshop on Very Large Corpora, 69-82. Cambridge, MA: Jun 1995. Also in Susan ARMSTRONG, Kenneth W. CHURCH, Pierre ISABELLE, Sandra MANZI, Evelyne TZOUKERMANN, and David YAROWSKY (editors), Natural Language Processing Using Very Large Corpora. Dordrecht: Kluwer. ISBN 0-7923-6055-9. Nov 1999. We describe two new strategies to automatic bracketing of parallel corpora, with particular application to languages where prior grammar resources are scarce: (1) coarse bilingual grammars, and (2) unsupervised training of such grammars via EM (expectation-maximization). Both methods build upon a formalism we recently introduced called stochastic inversion transduction grammars. The first approach borrows a coarse monolingual grammar into our bilingual formalism, in order to transfer knowledge of one language's constraints to the task of bracketing the texts in both languages. The second approach generalizes the inside-outside algorithm to adjust the grammar parameters so as to improve the likelihood of a training corpus. Preliminary experiments on parallel English-Chinese text are supportive of these strategies. Dekai WU. "Grammarless extraction of phrasal translation examples from parallel texts". TMI-95, Sixth International Conference on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Machine Translation, v2, 354-372. Leuven, Belgium: Jul 1995. We describe a method for identifying subsentential phrasal translation examples in sentence-aligned parallel corpora, using only a probabilistic translation lexicon for the language pair. Our method differs from previous approaches in that (1) it is founded on a formal basis, making use of an inversion transduction grammar (ITG) formalism that we recently developed for bilingual language modeling, and (2) it requires no language-specific monolingual grammars for the source and target languages. Instead, we devise a generic, language-independent constituent-matching ITG with inherent expressiveness properties that correspond to a desirable level of matching flexibility. Bilingual parsing, in conjunction with a stochastic version of the ITG formalism, performs the phrasal translation extraction. Dekai WU and Cindy NG. "Using brackets to improve search for statistical machine translation". PACLIC-10, 10th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation. Hong Kong: Dec 1995. We propose a method to improve search time and space complexity in statistical machine translation architectures, by employing linguistic bracketing information on the source language sentence. It is one of the advantages of the probabilistic formulation that competing translations may be compared and ranked by a principled measure, but at the same time, optimizing likelihoods over the translation space dictates heavy search costs. To make statistical architectures practical, heuristics to reduce search computation must be incorporated. An experiment applying our method to a prototype Chinese-English translation system demonstrates substantial improvement. Pascale FUNG and Dekai WU. "Coerced Markov Models for cross-lingual lexical tag relations". TMI-95, Sixth International Conference on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Machine Translation, v1, 240-255. Leuven, Belgium: Jul 1995. We introduce the Coerced Markov Model (CMM) to model the relationship between the lexical sequence of a source language and the tag sequence of a target language, with the objective of constraining search in statistical transfer-based machine translation systems. CMMs differ from standard hidden Markov models in that state sequence assignments can take on values coerced from external sources. Given a Chinese sentence, a CMM can be used to predict the corresponding English tag sequence, thus constraining the English lexical sequence produced by a translation model. The CMM can also be used to score competing translation hypotheses in N-best models. Three fundamental problems for CMM designed are discussed. Their solutions lead to the training and testing stages of CMM. Eva FONG and Dekai WU. "Learning restricted probabilistic link grammars". IJCAI-95 Workshop on New Approaches to Learning for Natural Language Processing. Montreal: Aug 1995. Also in Stefan WERMTER, Ellen RILOFF, Gabriele SCHELER (editors), Connectionist, Statistical, and Symbolic Approaches to Learning for Natural Language Processing, 173-187. 1996. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. We describe a language model employing a new headed-disjuncts formulation of Lafferty's (1992) probabilistic link grammar, together with (1) an EM training method for estimating the probabilities, and (2) a procedure for learning some simple lexicalized grammar structures. The model in its simplest form is a generalization of n-gram models, but in its general form possesses context-free expressiveness. Unlike the original experiments on probabilistic link grammars, we assume that no hand-coded grammar is initially available (as with n-gram models). We employ untyped links to concentrate the learning on lexical dependencies, and our formulation uses the lexical identities of heads to influence the structure of the parse graph. After learning, the language model consists of grammatical rules in the form of a set of simple disjuncts for each word, plus several sets of probability parameters. The formulation extends cleanly toward learning more powerful context-free grammars. Several issues relating to generalization bias, linguistic constraints, and parameter smoothing are considered. Preliminary experimental results on small artificial corpora are supportive of our approach. Dekai WU and Pascale FUNG. "Improving Chinese tokenization with linguistic filters on statistical lexical acquisition". ANLP-94: 4th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing, 180-181. Stuttgart: Oct 1994. The first step in Chinese NLP is to tokenize or segment character sequences into words, since the text contains no word delimiters. Recent heavy activity in this area has shown the biggest stumbling block to be words that are absent from the lexicon, since successful tokenizers to date have been based on dictionary lookup (e.g., Chang & Chen 1993, Chiang et al. 1992, Lin et al. 1993, Wu & Tseng 1993, Sproat et al. 1994). We present empirical evidence for four points concerning tokenization of Chinese text: (1) More rigorous ``blind'' evaluation methodology is needed to avoid inflated accuracy measurements; we introduce the nk-blind method. (2) The extent of the unknown-word problem is far more serious than generally thought, when tokenizing unrestricted texts in realistic domains. (3) Statistical lexical acquisition is a practical means to greatly improve tokenization accuracy with unknown words, reducing error rates as much as 32.0%. (4) When augmenting the lexicon, linguistic constraints can provide simple inexpensive filters yielding significantly better precision, reducing error rates as much as 49.4%. Dekai WU and Xuanyin XIA. "Learning an English-Chinese lexicon from a parallel corpus". AMTA-94: Assoc. for Machine Translation, 206-213. Columbia, MD: Oct 1994. We report experiments on automatic learning of an English-Chinese translation lexicon, through statistical training on a large parallel corpus. The learned vocabulary size is non-trivial at 6,517 English words averaging 2.33 Chinese translations per entry, with a manually-filtered precision of 95.1% and a single-most-probable precision of 91.2%. We then introduce a significance filtering method that is fully automatic, yet still yields a weighted precision of 86.0%. Learning of translations is adaptive to the domain. To our knowledge, these are the first empirical results of the kind between an Indo-European and non-Indo-European language for any significant corpus size with a non-toy vocabulary.

ISBN 0-7923-6055-9. Nov 1999. We describe a method of using statistically-collected Chinese character groups from a corpus to augment a Chinese dictionary. The method is particularly useful for extracting domain-specific and regional words not readily available in machine-readable dictionaries. Output was evaluated both using human evaluators and against a previously available dictionary. We also evaluated performance improvement in automatic Chinese tokenization. Results show that our method outputs legitimate words, acronymic constructions, idioms, names and titles, as well as technical compounds, many of which were lacking from the original dictionary.

Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing the applicability of Gale & Church's (1991) length-based statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.

"Approximating maximum-entropy ratings for evidential parsing and semantic interpretation". IJCAI-93: 13th Intl. Joint Conf. on Artificial Intelligence, 1290-1296. Chamberry, France: Aug 1993. We consider the problem of assigning probabilistic ratings to hypotheses in a natural language interpretation system. To facilitate integrating syntactic, semantic, and conceptual constraints, we allow a fully compositional frame representation, which permits co-indexed syntactic constituents and/or semantic entities filling multiple roles. In addition the knowledge base contains probabilistic information encoded by marginal probabilities on frames. These probabilities are used to specify typicality of real-world scenarios on one hand, and conventionality of linguistic usage patterns on the other. Because the theoretical maximum-entropy solution is infeasible in the general case, we propose an approximate method. This method's strengths are (1) its ability to rate compositional structures, and (2) its flexibility with respect to the inputs chosen by the system it is embedded in. Arbitrary sets of hypotheses from the front-end processor can be accepted, as well as arbitrary subsets of constraints heuristically chosen from the long-term knowledge base. Dekai WU. "Estimating probability distributions over hypotheses with variable unification". AAAI-93: 11th National Conf. on Artificial Intelligence, 790-795. Washington, D.C.: Jul 1993. We analyze the difficulties in applying Bayesian belief networks to language interpretation domains, which typically involve many unification hypotheses that posit variable bindings. As an alternative, we observe that the structure of the underlying hypothesis space permits an approximate encoding of the joint distribution based on marginal rather than conditional probabilities. This suggests an implicit binding approach that circumvents the problems with explicit unification hypotheses, while still allowing hypotheses with alternative unifications to interact probabilistically. The proposed method accepts arbitrary subsets of hypotheses and marginal probability constraints, is robust, and is readily incorporated into standard unification-based and frame-based models. Dekai WU. "An image-schematic system of thematic roles". PACLING-93: 1st Conf. of the Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics, 323-332. Vancouver: Apr 1993. We describe a system of thematic roles and frames designed to address a number of problems in semantic representations at the lexical semantic level. Our primary objective is broad expressiveness, so that real domains can practically be encoded. However, for both empirical and computational reasons we limit the number of role types to four, allocating this structure to the strongest associations. We show how the system incorporates image-schematic semantics to encode various schematization operations relating to scales and reification. Andreas STOLCKE and Dekai WU. "Tree matching with recursive distributed representations". AAAI 1992 Workshop on Integrating Neural and Symbolic Processes---The Cognitive Dimension. San Jose, CA: Jul 1992. Also available as ICSI Technical Report TR-92-025. We present an approach to the structure unification problem using distributed representations of hierarchical objects. Binary trees are encoded using the recursive auto-association method (RAAM), and a unification network is trained to perform the tree matching operation on the RAAM representations. It turns out that this restricted form of unification can be learned without hidden layers and producing good generalization if we allow the error signal from the unification task to modify both the unification network and the RAAM representations themselves. Dekai WU. "Active acquisition of user models: Implications for decision-theoretic dialog planning and plan recognition". User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction 1(2): 149-172. 1991. This article investigates the implications of active user model acquisition upon plan recognition, domain planning, and dialog planning in dialog architectures. A dialog system performs active user model acquisition by querying the user during the course of the dialog. Existing systems employ passive strategies that rely on inferences drawn from passive observation of the dialog. Though passive acquisition generally reduces unnecessary dialog, in some cases the system can effectively shorten the overall dialog length by selectively initiating subdialogs for acquiring information about the user. We propose a theory identifying conditions under which the dialog system should adopt active acquisition goals. Active acquisition imposes a set of rationality requirements not met by current dialog architectures. To ensure rational dialog decisions, we propose significant extensions to plan recognition, domain planning, and dialog planning models, incorporating decision-theoretic heuristics for expected utility. The most appropriate framework for active acquisition is a multi-attribute utility model wherein plans are compared along multiple dimensions of utility. We suggest a general architectural scheme, and present an example from a preliminary implementation. Dekai WU.

But the more important thing is that through the contest our students learned not only programming but also working in teams, demonstrated their competency and fulfilled their wishes. Many credits should go to the PG coaches Cho and Ben.", Dr. Tang said. There are about 20 teams from different local universities to join the local programming contest, and they had to solve 6 problems in 4 hours. The competition this year is considered to be keener than last year, as only 8 teams got the ranking. The 1st to the 3rd place solved 2 problems and the 4th to the 8th solved one problem only within the given time. The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) has been based at Baylor University since the 1980s, with IBM's sponsorship beginning 1997. Up to now, more than 10,000 participants of the contest are coming from over 1,300 universities from 68 countries on six continents. Within the limited time, participants are being challenged for their creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs.

Thesis Defense Tips Congratulations for all your hard work. To succeed at the final step, the defense, here are some suggestions: In preparation, check and recheck your slides for errors. Make sure you know the answers to the difficult questions from your proposal defense. Don't overuse abbreviations in your slides or at least make sure your audience understands what they mean. Look at the construction of your graphs. Make sure they are an exact representation of what you are talking about. Be prepared with names and references to back up facts and assumptions. Make sure you know you know how to pronounce the vocabulary you will be using. Think of ways to pull your defense apart. Maybe friends can help. Once you are in the room, turn off your mobile phone. Your friends may want to wish you luck at the last minute. Very embarrassing! Before you start to speak take a deep breath, try to relax, speak slowly and clearly.

From daily mobile payment to personal healthcare monitoring, smart devices have penetrated into every part of our life. Along with the great convenience of smart devices, there also comes an increasing concern about their security issues, as the data involved is often extremely valuable and highly sensitive, gaining much attention from malicious attackers. Also, the limited computing resource, growing data transmission capability and expanding device-device connectivity have aggravated the security threats. As a result, securing the ecosystem of smart devices has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry. Among the research pioneers is Prof. Qian Zhang, who envisioned many years ago that great potential and serious threats coexist in smart devices. One major research of Prof. Zhang's group in HKUST is to build reliable and robust securing systems for smart devices, including the following aspects: (1) User-device interaction defines how the user accesses the device. From the perspective of security design, Prof. Zhang's group focuses on recognizing who is using the smart device. Existing user identification solutions either rely on expensive hardware, e.g., fingerprints, or require complex modeling and large computation power. As both the computation and battery are scarce resources on many smart devices, existing solutions do not work well. To fill the gap, Prof. Zhang's group builds two light-weight user identification systems for power-constrained devices. One uses the underlying pattern hidden in the human gesture dynamics as an identifier while the other one leverages the bio-vibrometry, i.e., the vibration response of the human body, to differentiate various users. According to their comprehensive evaluations on the volunteers, both systems can provide identification accuracy above 91% in small-scale scenarios of limited users (e.g., home scenario) with minimal power requirement and are robust to various confounding factors. (2) Fueled by the close cooperation among smart devices, the device-device connection is prevalent and forming secure pairing between devices lays the foundations of the security protection and data privacy preservation. Prof. Zhang's group has devoted much effort in this field and successfully built several systems, each of which targets different scenarios and provides various security levels. Touch-And-Guard (TAG) is their first research outcome. It uses hand touch as an intuitive means to establish a secure connection between a wristband wearable and the touched device. Specifically, it generates secret bits from hand resonant properties and uses it to authenticate each other and then communicate confidentially. The evaluations on 12 volunteers indicate that TAG can serve as a natural and user-friendly pairing interface by generating secret bits at a rate of 7.84 bit/s, 58% faster than conventional text input PIN authentication. Apart from that, a proximity-based mechanism with a better security level, Move2Auth, is also proposed. In Move2Auth, a user only needs to hold the smartphone and perform random rotations in front of the IoT device. As the rotations lead to significant variations and fast changes in signal attenuation and antenna polarization, a secure and random key can be extracted from the Received Signal Strength (RSS). By matching the RSS-trace and motion data captured by the built-in motion sensors on the smartphone, Move2Auth can create a secure link between these devices and can protect against a powerful active attacker who can arbitrarily tune transmission power. To further boost the security level, the research group also explored the possibility of secure pairing based on human bio-metrics: the Electromyogram signal (EMG) caused by human muscle contraction. By exploring stochastic nature hidden in the EMG signal to generate secure bits, their work proves that the secure key generated from the EMG signal has sufficient randomness and security--even when the attacker can perfectly copy the user's gesture, the generated secure key cannot be stolen or cracked. Extensive evaluation on the volunteers under different scenarios demonstrates that this system can achieve a competitive bit generation rate of 5.51 bit/s while maintaining a very high-security level. Also, the evaluation results with the presence of adversaries demonstrates that their system is very secure to strong attackers who can eavesdrop on proximate wireless communication, capture, or even imitate the legitimate pairing process with the help of advanced computer-vision-based techniques. (3) In the context of device-environment sensing, Prof. Zhang and her group members have explored the possible security attacks caused by the continuous, unobtrusive, and unrestricted sensing ability of mobile devices. They first investigate how to prevent mobile-camera-based piracy attack on physical intellectual properties, such as painting and sculpture. To this end, a new lighting system, Rainbow, is invented to pollute the pirate photo/video on the mobile camera but retains a good visual quality for the human observer. By carefully modulating the chromatic change and luminance flicker into the light system, Rainbow introduces a non-uniform variation into the reflected light energy from physical objects, thus maximizing the distortion caused by the camera's banding effect. Meanwhile, due to the color fusion ability and low-band pass characteristics of human vision, the visual quality for the human observer is not affected. Extensive objective evaluations under different scenarios indicate that this lighting system is robust with different confounding factors and can significantly pollute the piracy photos on various devices. After that, another potential but serious information leakage attack is also exhibited by demonstrating how the attacker can unobtrusively track users in an indoor scenario. The key is to explore the nonlinearity characteristics of the ambient light sensor to sense the high-frequency modulated location information with a low sampling rate. In particular, due to the nonlinear characteristics of electronic components inside the circuit, the amplifier in ALS exhibits some levels of nonlinearity. When two high-frequency signals are received by the ALS simultaneously, such nonlinearity renders the output signal of the amplifier violate the linear superposition rule and generate a low-frequency "shadow" signal. In light of this idea, the research group has built a low-power and unobtrusive indoor localization system, NALoc. The experiments on ALS sensors from Apple and Samsung devices confirm the feasibility of such a system and extensive experiments demonstrate that it is possible to derive the fine-grained location information unobtrusively from the ALS readings, which poses a brand-new security threat. Corresponding countermeasures are also discussed in their research paper.

Dimitris Papadopoulos Teaching Research Personal e-mail dipapado at cse dot ust dot hk contact address CSE Department HKUST Clearwater Bay Hong Kong resume Personal I am an Assistant Professor at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Boston University and I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Insitute for Advanced Computer Science of the University of Maryland. Previously, I received my Diploma in Applied Mathematics from the National Technical University of Athens. My research focus is the development of novel cryptographic protocols for a variety of application scenarios and problems related to clout data privacy, distributed maching learning, and blockchain settings. I regularly work on cryptographic schemes such as searchable encryption, verifiable computation, zero-knowledge arguments, etc. I am always aiming for provably secure solutions and for optimized implemented systems. News Our work with my student Javad Ghareh Chamani on Dynamic Searchable Encryption with small client storage and Forward/Backward privacy was accepted at NDSS 2020! This is joint work with collaborators from U. Maryland. Our work on Append-only Authenticated Dictionaries with applications in efficient Certificate Transparency was accepted at ACM CCS 2019! Joint work with collaborators from MIT, U. Maryland, and Stevens Institute. BitExTract, our tool for interactive Visualization of Bitcoin Exchange transactions, was accepted for publication at IEEE TVGC! template design:3Formed.co.uk

The interactions between the mobile devices have to be transparent to the end users and can be of many services - opportunistic networking, traffic offloading, computation offloading, cooperative streaming and P2P based k-anonymity location privacy service, to name a few. Whenever mobile users are willing to ``ask for help'' from their neighbours, they need to make non trivial decisions in their selections in order to maximise their utility. Current motivation approaches for mobile users that participate in such environments are of two types: (i) credit-based and (ii) reputation-based. These approaches rely either on centralised authorities or require prohibitively many messages or require tamper resistant security modules. In this survey we present (i) the characteristics of D2D ecosystems and the features of D2D applications and frameworks and (ii) the existing types of cooperation enforcing and incentive mechanisms and their requirements to be operational. Next, we discuss (i) a decentralised cryptocurrency that can be used to support the bookkeeping of a cooperation enforcing mechanism and (ii) the multiway trade-off between consistency, operational costs, in terms of messages exchanged and storage needs, and awareness in reputation-based cooperation enforcing mechanisms.

Last year our UG student CHAN Yun Kwan Emprise was awarded the 1st place in the same competition under the supervision of Prof DY Yeung. This year the championship again goes to CSE. CHEN Qifeng was awarded the championship with his project "KNN Matting" supervised by Prof CK TANG. This paper describes a general alpha matting approach for the simultaneous extraction of multiple image layers; each layer may have disjoint segments for material matting not limited to foreground mattes typical of natural image matting. The estimated alphas also satisfy the summation constraint. One application of this paper is to replace the background easily. The paper is accepted by CVPR 2012 and Qifeng will join the conference in providence, Rhode Island, USA in June. Qifeng has just accepted a PhD offer from Stanford University. LI Yuliang won the 3rd place with his project "Mining Generalized Order-Preserving SubMatrices from Gene Expression Data" supervised by Prof Wilfred NG. The submatrix mining problems, which are also known as biclustering, have been extensively studied. A submatrix pattern consists of a set of rows that shares common behaviour across a set of columns, which reveals interesting local correlations in the data matrix. The project focuses on the Order-Preserving SubMatrix (OPSM) pattern which is previously shown to be an effective tool for analyzing gene expression data. The OPSM pattern is generalized in three directions. First, the definition of OPSM pattern was relaxed by allowing a reasonable amount of fluctuation inside the pattern so that it becomes more robust in noisy gene data. Second, the data matrix was generalized to allow continuous distribution so that it can be applied to application with uncertain data like RFID tracking. Finally, the model was generalized to the mine OPSM patterns from recommender system with large and sparse rating matrices by allowing missing entries in the OPSM patterns which can be mined by an innovative fast heuristic algorithm. The award presentation ceremony was held on 19 April 2012 at HKUST.

On this web site, you can find the topics that we have worked on and the papers that we have published. You can see our most cited (according to Scopus and Web of Science) and most recent work on each topic, and how our efforts on the topics evolve with time. Please proceed to the web site by clicking on the following picture. HKUST-CSE Publications Panorama The web site is created automatically based on the collection of publications by our faculty members and students that is kept at the HKUST Institutional Repository. The key technology behind it is a hierarchical topic detection method named hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA). HLTA is developed by a research team led by Prof. Nevin L. Zhang and the software package is kept at GitHub: https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta. HLTA first learns a latent variable probabilistic graphical model based on word co-occurrences, then builds a topic tree from the model, and finally uses the tree to index the documents. Here is a part of the structure of the model learned from a collection of articles published in The New York Times. In the era of big data, people are often confronted with large collections of unstructured text documents. Gaining an overview of the contents is important to the realization the potential values of such data. However, this is a difficult task. HLTA is developed to meet this challenge. It has been previously applied on research papers published in recent year at top AI and Machine Learning venues. The results are shown at aipano.cse.ust.hk to help researchers track research trends and identify papers to read, and help conference organizers and journal editors identify reviewers for submissions.

TITLE: FYP Report FAQ
https://www.cse.ust.hk/ct/fyp/reports/fyp_faq.html
DATE: Thu, 07 May 2020 14:11:39 GMT, 4271
Toggle navigation HKUST CSE CT Website FYP Info FYP/FYT Schedule FYP/FYT Grading Dealing with Free Riders Finishing Up (April Checklist) FYP/FYT Oral Presentations FYP/FYT Short Video Success Tips Winner Comments FYP Reports Report Structure Quick Overview Proposal Proposal Template (MS Word) Monthly Reports Individual Ethics Essay Progress Report IEEE Reference Style Final Report Report FAQ Advisor Preferences Game FYP Tips Report Examples Other UG Support IELM 4110 Interview COMP 4911 Business Plan CVs & Cover Letters Proofreading Checklist PG Support Dissertations Thesis Defense Conference Papers Statements TOEFL / IELTS Conversation Class Other Info Word of the Day Grammar Writing Online English Quizzes Job Links Useful sites Interesting Websites HKUST CSE Dept. FYP Report FAQ Here are some FAQs regarding FYP reports Should we submit our paper in hard copy or soft copy? Please either send us a soft copy by e-mail or place a hard copy in the envelopes on the door of Room 3558. However, when you submit your reports to the FYP Management system, you do not need to give anybody a hard copy unless you are requested to do so. How many days in advance should we send our paper prior to meeting with a Communication Tutor? If you want your CT to do a good job, then the sooner the better - usually a few days minimum. What priority will my group's paper have over other FYP groups? Normally, we go by FIFO (first in, first out). Do we have to submit the entire paper or can we submit sections? For the two required FYP meetings, your CT will download what you submit to the FYP Management System and then print a hard copy, so you don't need to prepare anything for the meeting. For report drafts, just submit whatever sections you want help with. How long should the FYP Introduction be? There is no set word length for the Introduction, but it is usually at least one page long. For more information, see FYP Introduction. What is a Literature Survey, and can we skip it? It documents the background research you do. See Literature Survey. It is quite important, so you cannot skip it. What's the difference between an abstract and an introduction? An abstract is like a movie trailer. It provides a very brief statement of the essential content of your report. It's purpose is to give the readers a taste of what they get if they read the whole final report and motivate them to want to do so. It should be very short - about 150 words. The introduction provides the context for the report and tells the reader the purpose and plan of your project. It does not need to be as broad nor motivational as the abstract. It should be longer than the abstract and include the background of your topic, your objectives and a history of your approach or other similar approaches (i.e., your critical review or literature survey). Also, your introduction should be around 99% complete after you finish your progress report. You do not need to change it unless your CT or advisor makes revisions on to your progress report. For more information, see FYP Abstract. What's the difference between testing, evaluation and discussion? Testing is like playing a basketball game; evaluation is like the game statistics; discussion is like what the players or spectators say about the game afterwards. In your evaluation you summarize the results from testing and state how well you achieved your objectives. This is very objective (客觀的). In your discussion, you interpret the results based on your opinions, so it is more subjective (主觀的). In the discussion you can also mention what you could have done better. Nobody's perfect. Some of the best lessons of life are learned from our mistakes. For more information, see FYP Final Report. What's the difference between design and implementation? It depends on what your advisor expects. Please see FYP Advisor Preferences. How many pages should our report be? It depends on the nature of your project, the number of members in your group and what your advisor expects. Please see FYP Advisor Preferences. Should we use active or passive voice? It depends on what your advisor prefers. Please see FYP Advisor Preferences. Why is the FYP important? Many students mistakenly think that the FYP is only important because it generates a grade - but the benefits of a good FYP go far beyond a good grade. Employers will assume that, as a UST graduate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, you have a high standard of technical skills. But, in today's highly competitive, global market a high standard of technical skills is simply not enough. In addition, most students graduate with little or no work experience. Thus, a well planned,well written FYP might just give you the edge you need to beat out the competition. Increasingly, employers are looking to the FYP to gauge candidates': written English fluency attention to detail logical thinking skills clarity of thought pride and care in their work time management skills Copyright HKUST CSE Dept. 2020Blog template built for Bootstrap by @mdo.

TITLE: CODA: Facilitating Big Data Applications via Network Optimization | HKUST CSE

In an unprecedented era of big data, and with the rapid rise of cloud computing, scale-out big data applications running on large clusters are becoming the norm. However, as cluster and data scale grow, so does the execution time; discovering the potential of scaling big data applications requires developing novel techniques to keep the execution time manageable. In particular, communication is crucial for analytics at scale. Many of the big data applications are communication-intensive. Given the huge amount of data that needs to be synchronized among tens to thousands of workers, the communication stage can be the bottleneck that greatly affects the execution time. As a result, network system design has embraced new challenges and opportunities. The data center system platform in SING Lab HKUST After joining HKUST in 2012, Prof. Kai Chen has devoted himself to network systems design and implementation. For Kai and his SING Lab, one major theme of research is to provide efficient and intelligent networking support for big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, his group has implemented a 100+ node data center platform. As one of the many cutting-edge research projects done on top of the platform, the CODA system serves as a necessary and natural step towards practical network optimization for data-parallel applications. Traditional approaches toward improving network-level metrics are often misaligned with the goals of data-parallel applications. Although a data-parallel application treats all the flows in each communication stage (e.g., shuffle or broadcast) as a whole, the network treats each flow independently. To bridge this gap, the Coflow abstraction was proposed in 2012 to enable the network to realign its objectives with that of the applications. Since then, people have been working hard to make it practical. Throughout all their efforts, one requirement remained constant: all distributed data-parallel applications had to be modified to use the same Coflow API. Unfortunately, this is hard to do, because of the sheer number of computing frameworks available today. CODA makes a first attempt at addressing this problem head on. The intuition is simple: if we can automatically identify coflows from the network, applications need not be modified. There are at least two key challenges in achieving this goal. The first one is classifying coflows. Note that the identification must be application-transparent, i.e., involve no application modification. Unfortunately, unlike traditional traffic classification, coflows cannot be identified using five-tuples. The second challenge is avoiding the impact of misclassification, because even the best classifier will sometimes be wrong. To that end, the scheduling should be error-tolerant, i.e., it must be able to schedule coflows even when some flows have been misclassified. CODA Architecture CODA is a joint design to address these two challenges. For application-transparent coflow classification, CODA leverages domain-specific insights and simple machine learning techniques to capture the logical relationship between multiple flows. Furthermore, an incremental clustering algorithm is developed to provide fast identification with high accuracy. For error-tolerant coflow scheduling, a key design of late binding is proposed. By delaying the assignment of flows to particular coflows, CODA always errs on the side of caution and effectively minimizes the impact of identification errors. Testbed experiments and large-scale simulations with realistic production workloads showed that CODA can identify coflows with more than 90% accuracy and its scheduler is robust to inaccuracies. Overall, CODA's performance is comparable to that of solutions requiring application-level modifications, and significantly outperforms flow-based solutions. CODA appeared in SIGCOMM 2016, the flagship conference of ACM on the applications, technologies, architectures, and protocols for computer communication, widely recognized as one of the most challenging CS conferences. This is the first time for SIGCOMM to have home-grown papers from Hong Kong universities.

The Robo-lawyer is an AI-based real system geared towards the masses. Its primary task is to sort out essential matters for drafting the agreement from user's input of several questions. The user can retrieve an agreement only if he/she can answer all questions, showing that they have thoroughly considered all the matters of concerns. The Robo-lawyer system has many applications in different domains. The current system supports divorce and employment contracts. For example, Hong Kong's divorce rate in 2016 was more than double that in 1991. The rising demand for family mediation has been a mounting challenge for lawyers. Few divorcing couples actually realized that the high legal costs and procedural drag would take an emotional toll on themselves. Many of them are unwilling or unable to sit down for a mediation that could take months or years, especially for cross-border couples. A chatbot specialized in generating divorce agreements contracts can help them get through the process easier. To make the Robo-lawyer more like a real person, sentiment analysis has been employed to help identify true feelings and moods of a person heading to a divorce through the dialogue. When a user writes "I am glad", for instance, it should be interpreted as an expression of relief instead of being upbeat. It even makes effort to persuade couples to think twice before finally deciding to divorce. Watch a demo of the current system. This is a collaborative project with Albert SO, a CSE alumnus from HKUST, who chairs the Hong Kong Mediation and Arbitration Centre.

Let not the fruits of action be your motive. Nor let your attachment be to inaction. अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम् | विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम् || 14|| Bhagavad Gita, Chapter XVIII, Verse 14. adhiṣhṭhānaṁ tathā kartā karaṇaṁ cha pṛithag-vidham vividhāśh cha pṛithak cheṣhṭā daivaṁ chaivātra pañchamam.

FYP/FYT students are invited to direct and produce a story-telling video about your FYP/FYT. It may tell your challenges and joys during FYP/FYT. It may record your hard coding work during midnight. It may show the proud demo of your final results, and much more. The department will have a judging committee to vote for the award. No specific quota on the number of awards. The winning team(s) will receive: A cash prize of HKD1,000 per team. A "Best FYP/FYT video" certificate for each member of the winning team. The video will be the showcase of our department, and possibly be broadcasted on various occasions, i.e. department channel (department website, YouTube), undergraduate information day, and etc. More on FYP/FYT video: It's on voluntary basis, and will not be marked or contribute to your final FYP/FYT grade. Submission deadline (for 2018-2019): 6 June 2019 (Thursday), 23:59pm. Upload your video to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive etc., and email the shared link, together with the project code and title of the FYP/FYT to mmsend('csdee'). Suggested video length is within 5 minutes. The narration (if any) should be in English. The subtitles (if any) can be in English or Bilingual (English and Chinese). We're looking for videos that tell good stories with impact to future technologies. You fully decide the contents and format of the video. Don't constrain yourself to a video that simply record your FYP/FYT demo. "Best FYP" and "Best FYP/FYT video" are not necessarily related. Further inquires, please contact the FYP/FYT coordinator.

Nichols, "The Graphical Kernel System in Prolog," master's thesis, Dept. Computer Science and Eng., Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., 1985. What about Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a great tool for quick learning and finding references, but don't use it for references on your FYP or FYT reports. Instead, use it to FIND good references. Wikipedia is the combined work of millions of experts on millions of subjects, and it's free and usually accurate. However, its work is often not closely reviewed by experts, so the chances of a wiki page containing inaccuracies are much higher than the chances of a peer reviewed paper containing inaccuracies. Thus, when you write your FYP or FYT reports, use Wikipedia at the beginning to gain a general understanding of your topic and of possible related concepts, algorithms, design ideas and programming tools or techniques. Of course, also study any academic papers recommended by your advisor. Then, when you write your report, first cite references to the papers (if they are useful, especially in your introduction.) Next, if you want to use an idea from a wiki page, you can usually look at the footnotes to find at least one or two good references. Just be sure to do two things: Actually spend time to click on the wiki page footnote links and find the best paper or article or website to be your reference (rather than the wiki), and Be sure to use the October 2014 IEEE reference style described on this page and not just use the style given in the footnote. This may take a little work to get it just right, since many footnotes do not exactly follow IEEE reference style. In the rare event that a wiki page provides no suitable footnotes, just ask your advisor, a TA or your communication tutor. One more benefit of Wikipedia: In today's world, more and more non-native English speaking people are writing good peer reviewed academic papers, but this can often result in some non-standard grammar, spelling and word choice. On the other hand, Wikipedia is a collaborative project that allows native English speakers to modify wiki page content as well as the English grammar, spelling and word choice. Thus, for your reports, it is generally smart to favor the English grammar, spelling and word choice of Wikipedia over that of non-native English speaking writers. General Style Author names Use each author's initials and last name. Leave no space between initials, but do leave a space between the period following the last initial and the first letter of the last name: E.F. Codd. For hyphenated first names, use a period for each initial (for example, J.-L. Picard). Dates Include just the year of publication for books. For periodicals, normally include the volume number, issue number, and year. However, for popular periodicals, include the month and year. If a periodical appears more frequently than monthly, include the date with the month: 15 Mar. 2000. If a periodical appears quarterly, use the season or issue number, depending on the periodical's usage. For periodicals that appear irregularly, do not use the month: vol. 16, no. 5, 1997. Spell out May, June, and July; abbreviate the other months: Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. Use a slash for bimonthly issues (Aug./Sept. 2000) and an en dash for a quarterly (July-Sept. 2000). Capitalize the names of seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. Common Abbreviations of Words in References Conference Conf. Computer Comput. Intelligence Intell. International Int'l. Proceedings Proc. Technology Technol. Electronic references References to electronic repositories are acceptable in IEEE Computer Society publications, but they are not the references of choice for formal archival use. If possible, replace such references with references to printed material. However, when this is not possible, cite the electronic address along with as much additional information as possible. If the address itself becomes invalid in the future, the other information might help researchers find the same document elsewhere on the Internet. At the very least, a reference to an electronic source must include the Internet URL. Publications Italicize names of books (including collections), magazines, journals, newsletters, technical reports, white papers, and manuals. Use quotation marks to enclose names of articles, papers, theses, dissertations, technical notes, and technical memos. When listing conference abbreviations in a reference, use the conference abbreviation and the last two digits of the year: AAAI 07. After the name of a book, thesis, proceedings, or other book-like material, list the publisher, year of publication, and inclusive page numbers if applicable. Delete terms such as Co., & Co., Ltd., S.A., Publisher, and Publishing Co.; retain Press. Where the publisher is a university, add its location if needed for clarity, for example, Miami Univ., Ohio. Do not include the editor's name for a conference proceedings unless it is an edited volume published as a book. References for proceedings should tell where an interested reader can find the source, not where the conference took place. If a proceedings did not use a traditional publisher, provide the sponsoring organization and its location. Use an en dash to indicate multiple issue numbers, for example, vol. 5, nos. 1-4. If the name of a column is cited in the reference, use initial caps without quotation marks, for example, Embedded Computing. Titles Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions. Lowercase articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions, regardless of length. Example: Toward Better Real-Time Programming through Dataflow. To make a source easy for researchers to find, use the title as it originally appears. Do not add or remove hyphens, change words to preferred spellings, or lowercase internal capitals. For foreign-language references, provide the original title first, followed by its English translation (if available) in brackets: Zur experimentalen Aesthetic [Toward an Experimental Aesthetic]. For more information, see the IEEE Computer Society Style Guide or ask your communication tutor. Copyright HKUST CSE Dept. 2020Blog template built for Bootstrap by @mdo.

FYP Report Structure Every FYP or FYT is unique. The goal may be to solve a problem, improve an old system, combine two or more concepts, create a game, experiment with various algorithms, etc. The type of FYP or FYT you choose will affect your reports' content, but in most cases it will not affect the report structure. Below is the required report section outline for each of the three FYP/FYT reports. Report Section Outline Cover Page Title Page Table of Contents Introduction 1.1 Overview (Why you want(ed) to do this project) 1.2 Objectives (What things you want(ed) to accomplish in general) 1.3 Literature Survey (What work others have already been done related to your project) Methodology 2.1 Design (What you want(ed) to accomplish specifically and conceptually to meet each of your objectives) 2.2 Implementation (How each item of your design will be or is being or was carried out; tools and methods to use or used) 2.3 Testing (How you will test, are testing or have tested each item of your implementation) 2.4 Evaluation (How you will determine or have determined if you have accomplished each of your objectives) Project Planning (Who leads and who assists on each task plus a GANTT chart Required Hardware & Software (What hardware are software are required for development and usage of your system or work) References (How can readers find your information sources) Appendix A: Meeting Minutes (What you talked about during each meeting and what plans you made; best typed up immediately after each meeting) Appendix B: [Brief Description] (Supplementary information you may want your readers to see that is too detailed for the Methodology section) Appendix C: [Brief Description] (More supplementary information may want your readers to see that is too detailed for the Methodology section) Report Commonalities All three reports follow the same structure. The Proposal tells what you plan to do. The Progress Report is merely an updated version of the Proposal. The Final Report is the third and final version. You do not need to delete any information from your Progress Report or Final Report unless it is no longer relevant to your project. Your design section should be divided into several subsections (2.1.1, 2.1.2, etc.), and each design subsection usually maps back to one objective. However, you may have more than one design subsection related to a particular objective. Your implementation section should be divided into several subsections (2.2.1, 2.2.2, etc.), and each implementation subsection usually maps back to one design subsection. However, you may have more than one implementation subsection related to a particular design subsection. Your testing section should be divided into several subsections (2.3.1, 2.3.2, etc.), and each testing subsection usually with maps back to a particular implementation subsection or describes a particular type of testing. Your evaluation section should be divided into several subsections (2.4.1, 2.4.2, etc.), and each evaluation subsection usually maps back to a particular objective. Report Distinctives The most important parts of the Proposal are usually the Introduction, Project Planning and References. The Progress Report is the same as the Proposal, but it should contain more details in Methodology. The Final Report is the same as the Progress Report, but it should contain more details in Methodology. It also has three unique features: It has an Abstract that goes prior to the Table of Contents. Two new parts are added: 3. Discussion and 4. Conclusions. The Project Planning and the Required HW & SW go in appendices. Section Numbering The section numbering used here may be different from the section numbering used on examples of previous FYP reports or the section numbering used on some FYT reports.

FYP Advisor Preferences When you write your FYP reports, remember that you not only have to satisfy the CSE Department requirements but also your advisor's personal preferences. After all, your advisor will be grading your paper. The following are some FYP preferences, as stated by FYP advisors when they were surveyed. The information is intended to clarify expectations and help both you and your advisor save time. The preferences were last updated on September 19, 2019, and they are sorted by FYP group code, first for active FYP advisors and then for second readers. If your advisor or second reader has not commented on something or if you are still unsure about what your advisor wants, please try asking directly. For further information, see also FYP Grading. ACH1 All FYP report details Currently unknown AR1, AR2 Design vs. Implementation In my view, a report can be organized in many different ways depending on the project. Reference Sorting Alphabetically, as it makes it easier to search the list of references. Active vs. Passive Whatever is natural in the context is acceptable. Generally, this will turn out to be active voice, but I am not too dogmatic about it. No. of Report Pages I suppose the number of pages may depend on the project size, which may in turn depend on the number of students involved in the project. I have no strong opinions on this--as long as the descriptions are clear. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Demonstrate either hard work or creativity (ideally, both!) BL1, BL2 Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Active Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Technical contribution, deliverables/demo, efforts, reports and presentation CD1 Design vs. Implementation The design section is about system description, but the implementation section must use specific programming language. Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive For scientific writing, passive voice is better. No. of Report Pages Proposal: 6, Progress Report: 10, Final Report: 20 Key Factors in A or A+ Paper The group must have their own ideas in the project. The project should have enough difficulty. The demo should be impressive. The final report must be well written. CECI1, CECI2, CECI3 All FYP report details Currently unknown CK1, CK3, CK4, CK5, CK6 All FYP report details See the preferences of PSAN1 below, since both advisors are pretty much on the same page. CQF1, CQF2, CQF3, CQF4, CQF5, CQF6 Design vs. Implementation Design is about the organization of a system and implementation is usually about the technical components (algorithms, machine learning models). Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Both are ok. No. of Report Pages Proposal: 6 Progress Report: about 10 Final Report: 15-30 Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Its impact on society or academia. CSB1, CSB2 Design vs. Implementation Design must address the issues and solve the problems at hand. Implementation must address how the particular solutions are instantiated in the real system. For example, if I'm trying to design a system to provide fair access to the network, the design part should be addressing the scheduling as an abstract algorithm that deals with the fairness issue. It could be written in a mathematical form if need be. The implementation part depends on the system on which the algorithm is implemented. For example, if we use Linux we'll be able to use some specific data structures and some specific constructs that are available only in Linux, so the implementation part must describe the way we go from an abstract concept to a real system that can run on a machine. Reference Sorting Order of occurrence Active vs. Passive Personally I think it depends on the circumstances and the type of text but for our students and for technical writing and especially with their level of English writing, I believe active is easier on them. So let them first learn how to write in the active voice then they can explore the intricacies of the passive voice. No. of Report Pages Proposal: <= 10 pages, Progress Report: <= 10 pages, Final Report: <= 20 pages Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Completion of the project against the objectives set in the proposal or revised in the progress report. (I prefer an FYP with fewer realistic and achievable objectives and that is completed to one with a very fancy set of objectives of which may be less than half are achieved). Setting clear targets that are realistic with respect to the duration of the project. Proposing original and effective solutions to the problem (far away from anything too fancy) Concise and to the point presentation of the results with a well organized and readable report. Ability to adapt to the challenges during the course of the project. Mastery of the subject as demonstrated during the presentation and the Q & A. Attitude towards the FYP in general (some students take it as a bitter pill to swallow while others have fun doing their FYP and try to learn from it.) DES1, DES2, DES3, DES4, DES5 Design vs. Implementation Design: It is something high-level, which may contain schematic diagrams to describe the overall structure and data flow of the system/app. Implementation is the details about how to achieve what are described in the design section. For examples, the tools, frameworks, or algorithms used. Reference Sorting No preference as long as it is consistent. Active vs. Passive Active voice is preferred. No. of Report Pages The number of pages is unimportant as long as the ideas and details are clearly presented. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Reports with clear structure and logical flow Formatting and typesetting of the reports are aesthetically pleasing Students are actively engaged in working on the project tasks and produce quality work. DESCECI1 All FYP report details See the preferences above for CECI1-3 and DES1-5. DI1 Design vs. Implementation It depends on the project. Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Active No. of Report Pages No preference. Avoid including too many details, screenshots or code just to increase the number of pages. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper (i) The topic (ii) The quality of the work / creativity / innovation of the students (iii) The clarity and consistency of the writing style (including good use of English) (iv) The oral presentation DIP1 Design vs. Implementation Although I am not strict on this, I expect the Implementation section to provide detailed technical description of the techniques, algorithms, code, implementation libraries, infrastructure, hardware, etc. used in the project. The Design section should provide a more high level overview of the problem, model adoption, application uses, etc. Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive I am fine with active voice; students are working hard on this so there is nothing wrong with writing in this style. No. of Report Pages I am not picky about the length as long as the work was done and it is clearly presented. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Use of cutting-edge technologies, great presentation, attention to detail. Overall, I want the students to take the proposed FYP, make it their own, and take it to the "next level." DL1, DL2, DL3 Design vs. Implementation Design should contain ideas, architecture (block diagrams), flow charts, pseudo codes and algorithms. Implementation should contain: system components used (OS, web server, database, application servers) to implement the system; functionality, testing, screenshots, experimental evaluation, etc. Reference Sorting By authors and then by year of publication Active vs. Passive A mix is fine. No. of Report Pages Proposal: 20, Progress Report: 20, Final Report: 60 pages (or as long as it takes to contain all the important results) Key Factors in A or A+ Paper The group should go much beyond what I told them to do, having developed new algorithms, identified and addressed new problems, and the results should be substantial (evidence that the students had learnt a lot and spent a lot of time in carrying out the project.) DY1, DY2, DY3 Design vs. Implementation Design is the "what," and implementation is the "how." Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive Both OK. For active voice, "we" is better than "I." No. of Report Pages 5-10, 20-30, 40-50, respectively Key Factors in A or A+ Paper (1) Strong technical content (2) good technical writing and presentation (3) progress managed well FL1, FL2 Design vs. Implementation Design is about how one approaches the problem and has the high level structure of the proposed solution. Implementation is about how one actually implements it with a tool/programming language. Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Both have their roles. No. of Report Pages The number of pages is not important to me. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Good ideas, good writing, and technical depth GCH1, GCH2, GCH3 Design vs. Implementation Design is more schematic, while implementation should have more codes and actual implementation. Reference Sorting Order of occurrence Active vs. Passive Active No. of Report Pages As long as it is necessary Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Paper Innovation, writing and results GIB1, GIB2, GIB3, GIB4, GIB5 Design vs. Implementation It depends on the type of project. Reference Sorting By order of occurrence Active vs. Passive Either one as long as it's clear No. of Report Pages No. of pages is not important.Completeness of the content is more important. Avoid copying the entire project code to the report. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Excellent demonstration and a complete, working system GO1 Design vs. Implementation I don't make a distinction. Reference Sorting No preference as long as it's consistent Active vs. Passive Either is fine as long as usage is consistent through the report. FYP Presentation Demos Depends upon the project. I usually suggest a short student-run demo during the presentation and a demo in which the audience participates after the presentation. No. of Slides in the Presentation The number strongly depends upon how the slides are structured and how much information the students put on each slide. The more technical the talk, the more reason to use a presentation tool other than PowerPoint. I would strongly recommend that FYT students, at least, not use PowerPoint. HO1, HO2, HO3 Design vs. Implementation Not a big concern for me. Reference Sorting No preference Active vs. Passive Active preferred No. of Report Pages I don't have a strong opinion as long as reasonable (not too long or short) Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Outstandingly attractive game and proposal that shows it. HUA1, HUA2 Design vs. Implementation Design is more high-level. Implementation is the details about how to implement the design. Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Does not matter. Passive voice is used very often for technical writing. No. of Report Pages Proposal: 10, Progress Report: 25, Final Report: 40 Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Workload; Cool demo; and polished reports. JA1 All FYP report details No particular preferences KAI1, KAI2 Design vs. Implementation Implementation is at a higher level than design. But they can be mixed together. Reference Sorting Doesn't matter to me Active vs. Passive Active voice is much stronger. No. of Report Pages Proposal: 5, Progress Report: 15, Final Report: 30 But I don't think the number of pages matters. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper The student's own idea and the implementation of the idea. KWT1, KWT2, KWT3, KWT4 All FYP report details Currently unknown LEI1 Design vs. Implementation Design is the basic idea, and implementation is about the details, i.e., coding level. Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive Both are fine. No. of Report Pages I think content is more important. I do not have a page limit. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Some new ideas LIX1, LIX2 Design vs. Implementation In layman's terms, Design is what you want to achieve (in a little more detail than the Objectives so it can be distinguishable from them). Implementation is the procedures, steps and plans that have led you to the goal. Reference Sorting No strict requirement, but usually alphabetically ordered Active vs. Passive Both are fine :) No. of Report Pages The length really depends on how much work has been done and how much detail you want to use to describe it. We don't have a strict 'cutting line'. But we do have the guidelines (or suggested report lengths). My experience as a 2nd reader is that usually students tend to make the reports too long to squeeze in many details and fail to highlight the really important aspects. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Reporting is only part of the FYP / FYT grading scheme. Grading of the report may include it's technical contents, writing skills. LZ1, LZ2 Design vs. Implementation Design is the "what," and implementation is the "how." Reference Sorting Alphabetically Active vs. Passive Either is fine No. of Report Pages The number of pages is not important. The important things are organization and presentation. A good report should be easy to follow, paint a clear picture of the project, and be as concise as possible. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Attractiveness of final system to targeted users, technical depth, innovativeness MA1, MA2, MA3 Design vs. Implementation I believe Design is more about the high level framework for the implementation. In the Implementation Section, students should be more specific in the exact tools, setups, etc. that they finally use. Reference Sorting No preference as long as it's consistent Active vs. Passive No particular preference No. of Report Pages The most important thing is to have real substance. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper They really get something done. I don't mind if the project doesn't work, but they have to show that they have spent substantial effort on the project. Since I have regular meetings (once every 2 weeks) with my FYPs, usually I can tell if they work hard or not. MU1 Design vs. Implementation Design deals with architectural design, including the various components of the system. Implementation is about how we realize the design. Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive Active voice is acceptable. Sometimes it's better to use active voice to express the ideas. No. of Report Pages 6, 25, 40, respectively Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Clarity of presentation besides the quality of work. MXJ1, MXJ2 Design vs. Implementation Research methodology is about the general principle of design and implementation. Implementation methodology is the actual methods used. Reference Sorting Alphabetically, by the last name Active vs. Passive Perhaps active. As long as it is consistent, it may not be a big concern. No. of Report Pages Perhaps it depends on the type of projects. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Novel idea, solid design and implementation, high-quality demo NGOK1, NGOK2, NGOK3 All FYP report details No particular preferences stated PAN1, PAN2 Design vs. Implementation I think design is more about the system architecture or user interface, and implementation is more about how to do experiment, how to do implementation, and perhaps mathematical methods and algorithms. Reference Sorting Order of occurrence in the report Active vs. Passive Active voice No. of Report Pages Proposal: 10 to 15 pages. Progress report: 20 to 30 pages. Final report: around 50 pages. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Novelty and a completed study. Nice demo and prototype will also help. I would prefer students to do a very specific work and do it very well rather than trying to touch a lot of stuffs but none of them is completed. PSAN1 Design vs. Implementation Design is the general idea and plan of attack; implementation is the details on how to program them. Reference Sorting Alphabetically, but no strong preference Active vs. Passive Indifferent, as long as it is consistent No. of Report Pages Usually, 20, 40, 60, respectively, but this highly varies from project to project, especially on the final report. For a results-heavy project, lots of additional pages are needed for detailed results analysis. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper 1. Work hard throughout the year. 2. Get a complete system working. Even if they don't implement all the features, get a basic set that fully works and achieves the basic goals. It is better than going on multiple fronts and not having time to combine it all at the end (which happens quite often). QIAN1 Design vs. Implementation Design handles more on the idea and architecture; implementation cares more about the how to make a particular solution work in the real system. Reference Sorting By order of occurrence in the report Active vs. Passive A mixed one [with both active and passive] is fine with me No. of Report Pages No preference. The key is have the key points clearly stated; avoid pasting the source code and screen copies for the demo system. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Creative idea, nice final result, good presentation QUAN1, QUAN2 All FYP report details Currently unknown RAYW1, RAYW2, RAYW3 Design vs. Implementation Design corresponds to the *conceptual* idea for the project. Implementation corresponds to the *concrete software/hardware* for the project. Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive I have no special feelings. No. of Report Pages The total number of pages should satisfy the requirement set up by our department. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper (a) The technical content should be good (b) The group should spend a lot of time on this project (c) The presentation of the report should be clear (d) The oral presentation should also be clear RIC1, RIC2 Design vs. Implementation Design, we usually refer to the design of the environment, or architecture. Implementation, we usually refer to the implementation that we think of to solve the problem. Reference Sorting Usually, easier to arrange by order of occurence. Active vs. Passive No preference No. of Report Pages No preference, as long as they can explain what is needed to explain. Key Factors in A or A+ Paper I don't think there is a standard scheme. I prefer to make this flexible. :-> RICWTAO1 All FYP report details Same as for RIC1, RIC2 RO1, RO2, RO3 Reference Sorting By order of occurrence in the report Active vs. Passive Should be passive in general No. of Report Pages Unlimited in my opinion SC1, SC2 Design vs. Implementation Design refers to the architecture by which the target system is to be implemented. Implementation refers to the techniques and approaches by which the FYP is to be carried out. Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive It is fine to write some sentences in passive voice. No. of Report Pages 10-20, 24-40, 30-60, respectively; larger groups should submit reports with richer content Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Demonstrate good problem solving techniques, good presentation and well-written reports. SCH1 Design vs. Implementation In the "Design" section I expect a discussion of the input representation, internal data representation, and output representation. In the "Implementation" section, I expect a high-level description of the solution strategy. Reference Sorting Alphabetically (by author's surname) Active vs. Passive Passive voice should be avoided as much as possible. No. of Report Pages <= 10, 10, 20, respectively FYP Presentation Demos Snapshots in the middle and full demo at the end No. of Slides in the Presentation <=20 (not counting extra slides for animation and effects) Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Success of the project, quality of work per student, technical depth SYQ1, SYQ2, SYQ3 Design vs. Implementation The design section mostly describes the global picture of a project and lists the novelty and comprehensive overview of the project. The implementation section describes the project in more details, e.g., each of the tools/algorithms used in each component. Reference Sorting Either one should be fine. Active vs. Passive Both should be fine. Usually in CS papers we just use active voice. No. of Report Pages Proposal: About 5-10 pages. (If there are many figures, better to have 10-15 pages) Progress Report: Depends on the progress. Final Report: 15-30 pages. (If there are many system/demo figures, better to have 30-50 pages) Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Writing (typesetting and formatting): 20% Structure and logic: 30% Technically sound: 20% Comprehensiveness (systematic work): 20% Novelty and nice final results: 10% TA1, TA2 Design vs. Implementation For most graphics projects (not game projects), there is no "Design" section. The students are asked to implement a system proposed in a recent research paper. Reference Sorting No preference Active vs. Passive Active voice mostly - concise and easy to read No. of Report Pages ~10, 20, 30, respectively Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Accomplish something that is technically challenging or come up with an innovative idea. TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4 Design vs. Implementation As the nature of projects varies, we should allow different structures/sections in the FYP reports. Reference Sorting I personally prefer by order of occurrence in the report. But in general any order should be OK for me. Active vs. Passive In technical writing, active voice is preferred. No. of Report Pages In general, I prefer concise reports. Proposal: 3-5 single-spaced pages Progress Report: 5-10 single-spaced pages Final Report: 15-20 single-spaced pages Key Factors in A or A+ Paper Accomplish something that is technically challenging or come up with an innovative idea. WEI1, WEI2 Design vs. Implementation In my opinion, the Design section plainly states what has been done in the proposed system, including but not limited to the overview of system architecture, the detailed design of each system component, and how these components interact with each other. In the Implementation section, justifications of the major system design choices could be provided, e.g., why the system is designed the way it is; any pros and cons in the design; what tradeoff has been made in the design space. Also, I expect to see some discussions on the limitations and potential extensions of the system. Reference Sorting By order of occurrence Active vs. Passive In CS, we recommend using the active voice in writing, which makes the report more engaging to read. No. of Report Pages Proposal: < 5 Progress Report: < 10 Final Report: No page limit Key Factors in A or A+ Paper 1. Does the project solve an interesting and relevant problem? 2. Is the proposed solution novel and practical? 3. Is the proposed solution/system well implemented with a good amount of engineering efforts? 4. Has the solution/system been thoroughly evaluated in various scenarios and settings? 5. Is the report well written? WIL1 Design vs. Implementation Design - system overview, data view, e.g..

The research by Prof. Qifeng Chen shows that an AI program can successfully render fictional novel scenes based on human input. As shown in the first figure, the deep learning model called the cascaded refinement network is able to generate photographic images based on semantic layouts. Learning-based image synthesis is connected to central problems in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. First, consider the problem of photorealism in computer graphics. A system that synthesizes photorealistic images from semantic layouts would in effect function as a kind of rendering engine that bypasses the laborious specification of detailed three-dimensional geometry and surface reflectance distributions, and avoids computationally intensive light transport simulation. Another source of motivation is the role of mental imagery and simulation in human cognition. Mental imagery is believed to play an important role in planning and decision making. The level of detail and completeness of mental imagery is a matter of debate, but its role in human intelligence suggests that the ability to synthesize photorealistic images may support the development of artificial intelligent systems. More recently, the research of Qifeng studies a semi-parametric approach to photographic image synthesis from semantic layouts. The second figure shows the image synthesis results by the semi-parametric approach. This approach combines the complementary strengths of parametric and nonparametric techniques. The nonparametric component is a memory bank of image segments constructed from a training set of images. Given a novel semantic layout at test time, the memory bank is used to retrieve photographic references that are provided as source material to a deep network. The synthesis is performed by a deep network that draws on the provided photographic material.

The HKUST team consisted of PG candidates Nathan Liu, Bin Cao, Luheng He, and their supervisor Prof. Qiang Yang. The competition was open to all academic institutes, industries as well as individuals around the world. Since its inception in 1997, the KDDCUP competition has presented practical and challenging data mining problems. The KDDCUP datasets have become benchmarks for the data mining field. The 2011 ACM KDDCUP was organized by Yahoo! Labs. The theme this year is prediction models for personalized recommendation for musical items based on billions of user ratings amassed at Yahoo! music over the years. When properly analyzed, the raw ratings encode information on how songs are grouped. The hidden patterns link various albums, which artists complement each other, and above all, which users would like to listen to. Good solution to the problem can form the core technology to support personalized music listening as well as other types of recommendation systems. More than 1,000 teams worldwide participated in the competition. It marks the KDDCUP this year one of the most competitive ones in its history. The HKUST team and their SHJTU peers proposed an ensemble of many large scale machine learning and data mining techniques to tackle the challenge. Their algorithm was also rated the best among all the submissions for single-model category.

Dr. Ngok LAM (cv available upon request) BEng (CUHK), MPhil (CUHK), M.S (Calif), PhD (McGill) Email: lamngok at cse dot ust dot hk Profile: Ngok LAM received his post secondary education from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (through secondary six early admission scheme), the University of California, and the McGill University. While at the University of California he was being supported by the DARPA studentship, and he was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) studentship while at the McGill University. His primary research interest is concerned with the design of a speical kind of overlay network known as the Service Overlay Network (SON). It is well known that the Internet is unable to provide meaningful end-to-end Quality of Service guarantees (QoS) because of its decentralized nature. The Service Overlay Network is a proposed solution to this E2E QoS provisioning problem. With its special structure, the Service Overlay Network is able to provide reliable end-to-end QoS support on top of the Internet infrastructure without violating the Internet's canonical architecture. It has recently gained significant attention in the networking community as a viable alternative to overcome some fundamental functionality limitations of the Internet. Like many other telecommunications services, service overlay network is believed to exhibit network externalities in that the value of the network increases with the number of its users. Once the network reaches a "critical mass", it will continue to grow in a self-reinforced manner. Ngok LAM's primary research interests are the economic design of a SON network and the optimal pricing of the SON services. By studying the SON design problem in an economic framework, it is possible to provide a financially feasible option to both the SON investors and the SON consumers in realizing the SON infrastructure, which helps the SON network to reach a "critical mass" that would eventually lead to the success of the SON as a service provider network.

Upon successful completion of the Co-op Program, the student meets both Industrial Experience and FYP graduation requirements. Background of Final Year Projects Final Year Projects (FYP) aim to provide an opportunity for students to apply and integrate the knowledge acquired throughout their undergraduate studies. The projects also aim to develop the capabilities of students in analyzing and solving complex and possibly real-case problem and to develop the skills of students in the systematic development, documentation and presentation of a significant piece of work. Arrangement The Co-op program MUST be at least 5-month long. It can take place in either the Fall semester (e.g. September to January of the following year) or the Spring semester (e.g. February to June). The exact start and end dates are to be discussed and agreed between the company and the student. Students are expected to work full time in the company during Co-op. They may take Leave from Study during the Co-op period. Students are not encouraged to defer their graduation because of the participation in the Co-op program. They should plan in advance and consult with their advisor(s) on their plan of study and credit overloading so as to complete the degree program within the normal duration of study. Final year and penultimate year undergraduate students in COMP, COSC, DSCT, COGBM programs are eligible to apply for the program. Benefits To the Co-op Company: A Co-op company will benefit from a cost-effective intellectual investigation of new/on-going projects A Co-op company will be able to select long-term full-time interns and potential future employees from a pool of capable students Responsibilities Of the Co-op Company: Identify and propose an Industrial Project that resembles a Final Year Project Identify a member of staff with appropriate background to serve as the Industrial Supervisor of the Co-op student. The Industrial Supervisor is expected to sit on the assessment panel together with the Academic Supervisor and another HKUST faculty member at the student's Final Presentation to be scheduled during the last week of the Co-op Evaluate the student's work performance by completing the Supervisor Feedback Form at the end of the Co-op Enquiries Professor James Kwok Department of Computer Science and Engineering Email: mmsend('jamesk') About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements Last updated on 2020-04-02 Privacy Sitemap Copyright © The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Toggle navigation HKUST CSE CT Website FYP Info FYP/FYT Schedule FYP/FYT Grading Dealing with Free Riders Finishing Up (April Checklist) FYP/FYT Oral Presentations FYP/FYT Short Video Success Tips Winner Comments FYP Reports Report Structure Quick Overview Proposal Proposal Template (MS Word) Monthly Reports Individual Ethics Essay Progress Report IEEE Reference Style Final Report Report FAQ Advisor Preferences Game FYP Tips Report Examples Other UG Support IELM 4110 Interview COMP 4911 Business Plan CVs & Cover Letters Proofreading Checklist PG Support Dissertations Thesis Defense Conference Papers Statements TOEFL / IELTS Conversation Class Other Info Word of the Day Grammar Writing Online English Quizzes Job Links Useful sites Interesting Websites HKUST CSE Dept. FYP Abstract What it is Your abstract is a brief statement of the essential content of your final report. It is like a movie trailer in text format. It's purpose is to give the readers a taste of what they will see if they read the whole final report. It goes after your title page and Acknowledgements (if any) and before your Table of Contents. What to write Your abstract should be very short - about 50-200 words. It should state: what was done or produced how it was done principal results the significance of the results Notes Your abstract is the last thing you write for your FYP final report. You do not need an abstract for your proposal and progress report. The abstract is different from the introduction. (See Final Report.) Example Pair trading is a simple trading strategy which involves finding a pair of stocks that exhibit similar historical price behavior and then betting on the subsequent convergence of their prices in the event that they diverge. Since this trading style is very applicable to all asset classes, the methods to identify pair trading signals are widely researched. However, the effectiveness of existing rule-based strategies has been reduced because of increased market competition. In this project, we conducted rigorous studies on existing pair trading strategies proposed in academic papers. We implemented and backtested three popular pairs trading strategies (the Distance method, the Cointegration method with Rolling OLS and the Cointegration method with a Kalman Filter) to better understand their profitability, strengths and weaknesses under different market conditions. The core achievement of this project was a novel approach to perform pairs trading by adopting a Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm. The proposed RL trading agent was backtested over three separate periods (2016, 2017 and 2018) to facilitate a comprehensive comparison between the existing strategies and our RL trading agent. Finally, we implemented a front-end web application for data visualization of the trade actions and performance of the four pair trading strategies.

TITLE: Qiong's Directions to CS Dept of HKUST
https://www.cse.ust.hk/~luo/me/directions.html
DATE: Tue, 02 Jan 2018 04:58:10 GMT, 3425
Qiong's Directions to the CS Dept of HKUST Last updated on Jan 2, 2018 This short note contains four tips intended for first-time visitors to get to the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Depatment of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). First of all, please bear in mind that HKUST is one of the eight universities in Hong Kong. Two older and better-known ones are Hong Kong University (HKU) and Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). If you ask directions to HKUST in the city, you might want to tell people that you are going to the university in Clear Water Bay (in Chinese characters: ) near Sai Kung, even though HKUST is officially in the district of Kowloon (). The Chinese name of HKUST is written as . Second, HKUST is a little bit remote (see a map of HKUST's location) by Hong Kong's standard, because it is by the sea, on the hills, and not directly reachable by MTR (Massive Transit Railway, the public subway transportation)! The nearest MTR stations to HKUST are Hang Hau (to the south of HKUST, exit B1) and Choi Hung (to the west of HKUST, exit C1). You can then take mini-buses (11,11M or 11S, all having signs showing "HKUST" as the destination) from these MTR stations. The bus ride takes about 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, you can take a taxi to HKUST from any point in the city. A taxi ride from the Hong Kong airport to HKUST goes all the way east, takes about 40 minutes, and costs around HK$350 (US$45). Other trips from some place around Hong Kong to HKUST are typically much shorter than the airport ride. Third, you don't need to worry about which building to go to in HKUST - there is only one huge, octpus-like academic building on the campus. If you see the main gate of HKUST after stepping off a bus or a taxi, walk about a hundred meters down the hill, and you will be in the university piazza with a red sundial structure in the center. The academic building is right in front of you. Fourth, the CSE Department is on the third floor of the academic building, near Lifts (Elevators) No. 25-26. When you walk into the atrium (the lobby space with seven-floor high glass ceiling) of the academic building, you will see stairs and escalators on the right. Take the escalator up and you will be in the academic concourse. Walk along this concourse by about another one hundred meters, you will see a little coffee shop with tables and chairs outside. Turn left before you run into the coffee stand and you will see Lifts 25-26 on your right. Ride either elevator to the third floor, step out of the elevator, and go through the door on your right. You will see the Office of the CS Department across the hallway. The administrative staff in the office will be happy to get you your host. Enjoy your visit at the CSE Department, at HKUST, and in Hong Kong! Qiong Luo

The annual contest is the second to be held in Hong Kong and it is open to full-time undergraduate students attending an accredited education institution in Hong Kong or Macau. This year, the contest attracted 37 teams from seven universities in Hong Kong and one university in Macau. The objective of the contest is to challenge students, working in teams of three, to solve real-world database programming problems with the latest relational database technologies in a given time frame. Each university was allowed to send five teams to the event. The teams from HKUST achieved great success this year and won the Champion University Award in the contest. They obtained the highest combined scores in comparison with all the teams from the other universities. We are grateful for contributions from all our team members. They include (see more detailed information): PG coach: Ji Luo Team 1 Leader: WONG Ka Chun LI Yuliang YU Ka Cheuk Team 2 Leader: LAM Wing Kwun KWOK Chun Wing NG Cheuk Ki Team 3 Leader: YAN Zhepeng Chen Chen Li Maocheng Team 4 Leader: CHAN Sing Fu (Neville) WONG Kai Hong (Michael) LEE Ka Wai (Ralf) Team 5 Leader: ZHAO Zhou HUNG Chiu Lung (Desmond) CHEN Qifeng Dr. Wilfred NG with some of the members from the winning teams More News Navigation Navigation About Welcome Mission & Vision About CSE Fast Facts News & Events Job Openings Contact Us People Faculty Staff Postgraduates Alumni Research Research Areas Research Labs & Centers Research Projects Computing Facilities Academics Undergraduate Postgraduate Enrichment Quality Assurance Admissions Undergraduate Postgraduate PG Early Recruiting Graduate Placements Last updated on 2009-02-16 Privacy Sitemap Copyright © The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Personal and Teaching Statements This page offers some guidelines for writing personal statements and teaching statements. Guidelines for Writing a Personal Statement A personal statement is, in fact, a research statement. You need to follow a certain structure or at least provide certain information. Try to keep it short - only one or two pages - since you are sending it to a very busy person! Try to avoid describing what you did as a child. Most academics are not interested, so including this information would most likely only hurt your application. 1st Paragraph Describe the area of research that interests you and why. If you have already done some research work in this area, be sure to mention it. Also, explain why you think you are suitable for this area. You may also describe competitions in the area that you have done well in and special academic attainments. For example, a double major in mathematics and computer science probably set you apart from students who only studied computer science. If you have nothing special to say, then just mention briefly how you came to choose this area. 2nd Paragraph Describe research programs you have worked on (one paragraph per program.) What did you find? What did you learn? What approaches did you try? Did these approaches work or not? 3rd Paragraph Explain why you feel you need a Masters degree or PhD. 4th Paragraph Tell the reader why you want to go to that particular university. Make it easy for them: If you want to work with a particular person or persons tell them who you want to work with and why. If you want to work in a particular area, tell them why you want to work in that area in their university. If there is no particular person you want to work with or particular area you want to work in, explain why you would like to join their program. 5th Paragraph You can also state what papers you have read from that university and what you enjoyed about them or how they inspired you. Lastly, tell them what you hope to gain from their university. Guidelines for Writing a Teaching Statement Different from a personal statement, a teaching statement focuses on your philosophy of education and teaching experience. You can highlight any innovative lessons you have designed and taught and include any positive feedback you have received either from your supervisors or the students themselves. Try to make your enthusiasm and motivation for teaching obvious. Try to keep the statement to two pages or less, especially if you are also sending a personal statement and CV. Since this type of statement is more difficult to put into a specific structure than a personal statement, try include all the elements mentioned above and then e-mail it to your communication tutor for copy editing. After you write a draft of your statement, please send it to your communication tutor for copy editing. Copyright HKUST CSE Dept. 2020Blog template built for Bootstrap by @mdo.

This is precisely the work being prototyped by PhD student Bing Yen CHANG and Prof. Andrew Horner in the Computer Music group. Listeners can direct where the music goes emotionally like a Movie Director guides how the composer develops the score. It is a new form of active listening! Listeners can take their favorite music to places it has never gone before, but could! They can bring out different emotional potential of the music - even some that may be deeply hidden in the music. For example, imagine Canon in D, but with an Angry tone - rendered in harmonic minor with a menacing quality like Phantom of the Opera or The Empire Strikes Back. Or, perhaps Tragic like a funeral march, or Lively like a Celtic folk dance on Irish flute, or Tenderly-Romantic like a love ballad. You don't have to imagine anymore, check it out: Canon in D. Every piece of music can be shaded or shaped to bring out the full range of emotional characteristics, in a similar way that Monet's Rouen Cathedral appears in dozens of different characters depending on the light and color (i.e., time of day, weather, lighting, shadows). He uses the same subject, the same viewpoint, the same style, but the different lighting and colors produce different moods. Paintings from Monet's Rouen Cathedral series. How can we similarly "shade" or "color" music so that is has different mood or emotional characteristics? The three main musical parameters for excitement level are pitch register (i.e., which octave), tempo, dynamics. We see this in real-life in over-excited trumpet players, who always want to play higher, faster, and louder! For the mood of the music (how positive or negative it is), the main musical factors are the particular mode of the music (e.g., major or minor), to a lesser extent the overall pitch range (high or low), and other melodic and harmonic aspects. In the near future, imagine bringing to life your own Carmen! Though your control of the music, play the matador Escamilla in the bullfight scene, and guide the music to parry the charges of a furious bull in the dusty ring while the screaming crowd cheers and gasps. Or, guide Carmen's dance that mesmerizes the carousing soldiers in the opening Habanera scene. Or, through your own emotional twists in the music, play Carmen in the final tragic encounter with her jealous former lover Don Jose outside the bullfight stadium with defiant bravado. What happens if Carmen successfully fights back? Or, what if she escapes to the bullring, facing off with Don Jose, Escamilla, and the bull, writing a new ending to the opera, with your version of the music telling the tale!

TITLE: FYP Final Report
https://www.cse.ust.hk/ct/fyp/reports/final_report.html
DATE: Thu, 07 May 2020 14:11:38 GMT, 9408
Toggle navigation HKUST CSE CT Website FYP Info FYP/FYT Schedule FYP/FYT Grading Dealing with Free Riders Finishing Up (April Checklist) FYP/FYT Oral Presentations FYP/FYT Short Video Success Tips Winner Comments FYP Reports Report Structure Quick Overview Proposal Proposal Template (MS Word) Monthly Reports Individual Ethics Essay Progress Report IEEE Reference Style Final Report Report FAQ Advisor Preferences Game FYP Tips Report Examples Other UG Support IELM 4110 Interview COMP 4911 Business Plan CVs & Cover Letters Proofreading Checklist PG Support Dissertations Thesis Defense Conference Papers Statements TOEFL / IELTS Conversation Class Other Info Word of the Day Grammar Writing Online English Quizzes Job Links Useful sites Interesting Websites HKUST CSE Dept. FYP Final Report The FYP final report is due in April. It is basically an extension of the progress report, except it should represent the final status of your project (or thesis.) Note that it has three or four new sections: Acknowledgments, Abstract, Discussion and Conclusions. It will also have more appendices. Looking at relevant FYP final report examples can be very helpful when you write your final report. If you are concerned about the length, keep in mind that quality is more important than quantity. You may also want to see your advisor's report preferences. Acknowledgments An an acknowledgement section is not required for FYPs, but it is common for FYTs. It's where you thank all people or companies that helped you complete the project successfully. You don’t need to mention every single person who helped you with the research- just those who were most important to your research. Typical people whom you can acknowledge can include your advisor, academic staff, PG students, other HKUST staff and industry sponsors It should be placed after your title page and before your Abstract. Abstract What's an abstract? Your abstract is a brief statement of the essential content of your final report. It is like a movie trailer in text format. It's purpose is to give the readers a taste of what they will see if they read the whole final report. It goes after your title page and Acknowledgements (if any) and before your Table of Contents. It is usually a brief yet interesting summary of: your project the extent of your research selected (important) results To help you write the abstract, try to think about the following questions: Why would another student or researcher be interested in this project or research? What are the most important aspects of the project or research? What should a reader be sure to know after reading your abstract? What information will the reader have to have in order to understand the most important aspects? What are the main points from each section of your report? Summarize each section in one sentence, if possible. In addition: Incorporate the key facts and conclusions from the body of the report. Write the abstract using mainly present simple verbs. Try to keep your abstract to 50-200 words. 1. Introduction The introduction provides the context for the report and tells the reader the purpose and plan of your project. The introduction does not need to be as broad nor motivational as the abstract. The introduction should be longer than the abstract and include the background of your topic, your objectives and a history of your approach or other similar approaches (i.e., your critical review or literature survey). Also, your introduction should have been 99% complete after you finished your progress report. You do not need to change it unless your communication tutor made revisions on your progress report. For more informaiton, see Introduction. 2. Methodology The methodology section should serve as an instruction manual with which another FYP or FYT student could completely duplicate your results. It should include facts, procedures, equipment, data, details, tests performed and results (success or failure or what degrees or each.) It should also tell the two professors who give you your grade what was special about your work. Beware of two extremes: Not explaining clearly what you did or being specific in how you did it. Telling about almost every tiny detail and boring the readers to death. (You don't need to write a user manual!) Instead, try to show your readers how you are intelligent, clever, skillful and resourceful and how you utilized your software engineering skills or computer science knowledge. For boring details, put them in appendices or just leave them out. Focus on what's important. Imagine what you would write if you were taking your report to a job interview and letting your prospective employer look at it! Why would he want to hire you? Or if you were to apply to grad school, would your report help or hurt your chances? For Design, think about WHAT you did: What does the system look like? What are the hardware and software components, and how do they relate to each other? What kinds of functions can different kinds of users perform and in what sequence can or should they perform them? What does the data look like that is used for input, and do you need to do anything to it before processing it? What processes are involved in the system, and how do they relate to each other? What algorithms or formulas were needed, and why did you use them? What does the output information look (or sound) like? (If you have a lot of screen shots, it might be best to put them in an appendix.) What elements of the user interface (UI) make it user-friendly and/or facilitate a good user experience (UX)? For Implementation, think about HOW you did it and HOW you applied your software engineering skills or other computer science knowledge: What data, coding tools, development kits, IDE, libraries and APIs did you use, and where did you get them? How did you set up the server (if your system has one)? How did you build your database, and how is it updated? What important steps did you follow as you built the system, performed experiments or recorded data? What cool or creative ideas did you come up with? What were the most difficult parts of building the system or solving your problem, why were they difficult and what steps did you take to try to overcome them? What assistance did you seek from your advisor or other knowledgeable people? For Testing, think about this: What could possibly go wrong from the user's point of view? (If you have a lot of test cases, you can list them in an appendix.) What types of tests helped to locate bugs or logic errors? How did you make the testing environment realistic? Did you need to run any simulation? What devices or equipment were used in the experiments? In the Evaluation, think about this: Did we accomplish each of our objectives? (Explain one-by-one.) What went well, and what didn't? What factors might discourage people from actually using the system in real life? (See also Evaluation or FYP final report examples.) What statistics, charts, or graphs might help me illustrate how good (or bad) the system or approach is? 3. Discussion Think about this: WHY did you succeed or fail or only partly succeed in accomplishing each objective? What does your reader need to know before anything else in order to understand and be persuaded to believe your argument? What is the most important thing for your reader to understand from your interpretation? Consider placing this first. For organization, you can either follow the sequence used in your Evaluation, or perhaps you can organize your information starting with what you are most happy or certain about and progressing towards matters that you are less happy or certain about. For research reports, the sequence might follow this outline: Discussion of the data Generalization or analysis of the data The relationship between the data and the research problem or hypothesis What can be inferred from the data 4. Conclusions In this section, you summarize the major technical accomplishments of the project and suggest areas for future research and analysis. Focus on: the key things you did and learned problems not addressed in your paper questions that were not answered in your paper what techniques or algorithms or tools might be useful for further development The Conclusions section doesn't need to be long. One page may be enough. Q&A about the final report What's the difference between testing, evaluation and discussion? Implementation and testing are like playing a basketball game. Evaluation is like the game statistics; discussion is like what the players or spectators say about the game afterwards. In your evaluation you summarize the results from testing and state how well you achieved your objectives. This is very objective (客觀的). In your discussion, you interpret the results based on your opinions, so it is more subjective (主觀的). In the discussion you can also mention what you could have done better. Nobody's perfect. Some of the best lessons of life are learned from our mistakes. What do we do with the Project Planning and Required HW & SW sections? You can simply move these to appendices, for example, "Appendix B - Project Planning" and "Appendix C - Required Hardware and Software". You can have several appendices, if necessary. In the past, some FYP groups had 5 or 10 different appendices. What if we changed our project scope and cancelled some objectives? You can delete all mention of the cancelled objectives in the final report, because they are no longer relevant, but be sure to mention what parts you cancelled and why you cancelled them in your Discussion. Can we change the title of our project? Yes! The title should accurately and concisely describe your project in its final state. Many FYPs start with a title that reflects a concept that is quite different from the final concept. Make your final title describe the final concept. If your CT suggested a new name and that name fits, it is probably best to use that title. How do we label pictures and graphs? Most writers center the picture or graph or table and put a description underneath which identifies the figure for easy reference and identification, for example: Figure 3 - System flowchart. To be reader-friendly, figures are also usually best placed directly under the paragraph that first references them, not several paragraphs down or on another page. What verb tense should we use? There is no fixed rule, because projects differ, and sections of the report differ. However, in general present tense is usually appropriate for concepts and application features, for example, "The frequency is denoted by ..." or "The system calculates ..." Past tense is usually appropriate for work you did, for example, "We developed a system..."

This year, there are 33 teams from Hong Kong and Macau joined the local contest at HKUST. Every year, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) sponsors regional and international collegiate programming contests. They have divided the world into 16 regions and each region has a regional contest, with the top two or three teams in each region going on to the international contest. Since 1991, the ACM Hong Kong Chapter has been organizing a local contest in Hong Kong, modeling after the ACM contests in terms of objectives, format, and style. This year, teams have been invited from the tertiary institutions in Hong Kong and Macau: Each department of a participating institution can nominate a maximum of two regular teams and a maximum of four regular and observing teams in total to take part in the contest. During the contest, students would form teams of 3 and would compete against the clock. The software used was Microsoft Windows 10 (1809) with Dev C++ 5.7.1, Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and Oracle JDK 1.8.0. Each team was given 8 programming problems and they would try to write programs to solve many of the problems as possible within the allocated time, which was 4 hours. The team that could correctly solve the most problems would win the competition. If there are multiple teams solving the same number of problems, the team that solved the fastest wins. This competition also shows that expertise in debugging and quick-and-dirty hacking is more valuable than rigid software engineering technologies in such kinds of environments.

We explore the former problem in sponsored search advertising, and the latter in human computation. In sponsored search, we study the assignment problem for context-based advertising, where advertisers have different valuations for different disjoint contexts. When no budget constraints exist, we show how the corresponding assignment problem can be decomposed into a set of disjoint assignment problems (one for each context). We subsequently address each of the disjoint problems using well-studied mechanisms, such as the truthful and socially optimal VCG auction or the industrially popular GSP procedure. Furthermore, we explore combinatorial auctions as a way to guarantee the search engine revenue. When budget constraints are present, we distinguish between two cases: advertisers may be indifferent to the price per click, or they may not be willing to pay more than their valuation. For the first case, we introduce a probabilistic framework from resource allocation markets. Under reasonable conditions, a Nash equilibrium always exists. To compute it, we introduce three methods that correspond to different families of distributed dynamics. In the second case, we cannot show that a Nash equilibrium always exists, but we manage to bound a player's most profitable deviation using concave relaxations of the utilities. In human computation, we address ranking in human computation games. We discuss how human computation games have the weak-link property, i.e., the game outcome is determined by low-skill players. To perform ranking, we develop three classes of scoring/rating algorithms. The first class is an ELO-based scheme, where players get rewarded if they perform better than expected, or punished in the opposite case. The second class introduces a Bayesian skill rating system; player ratings can then be computed by performing approximate inference. The third class utilizes results from item response theory, a family of latent trait models that are used to establish psychometric properties of items. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods in both problems.

TITLE: Spatiotemporal Machine Learning Models for Precipitation Nowcasting | HKUST CSE

It is a very important problem because it facilitates drivers by predicting road conditions, enhances flight safety by providing weather guidance for regional aviation, avoids casualties by issuing citywide rainfall alerts, among many possibilities. In addition to the inherent complexities of the atmosphere and relevant dynamical processes, the ever-growing need for real-time, large-scale, and fine-grained precipitation nowcasting poses extra challenges to the meteorological community and has aroused research interest in the machine learning community. A simplified version of the problem is illustrated below. After receiving a sequence of radar echo maps up to the current time step, the task is to predict the radar echo maps in the next few time steps based on which rainfall intensities in specific locations can be estimated. For example, the radar maps are taken from the weather radar every six minutes. Over the past few years, Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and his research students have collaborated with the Hong Kong Observatory to solve the precipitation nowcasting problem using weather radar data collected in Hong Kong since 2009. By formulating precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, they first proposed the ConvLSTM model [Shi et al., 2015] by incorporating convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Using the radar echo data collected in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2013 for model training, ConvLSTM gives more accurate predictions than the current algorithm used by the Hong Kong Observatory which is based on estimating the optical flow. Recently, the team proposed a more general model called TrajGRU [Shi et al, 2017] which extends ConvLSTM in several important dimensions. A major extension is that TrajGRU can actively learn the location-variant structure for the recurrent connections in the RNN model and hence can handle more natural motion and transformation such as rotation. Moreover, the dataset has been extended to cover seven years, from 2009 to 2015. Because of the further improvement in prediction accuracy, the Hong Kong Observatory is currently porting the TrajGRU implementation to their online system for more thorough testing. This collaborative project benefits both the academic researchers and the practitioners in that it has led to publications in a top machine learning conference as well as deliverables that are being incorporated into the operational system for real-world weather forecasting.

Developed by a team led by Prof Gary Chan of the Department of the Computer Science and Engineering, the location sensing technology – a software suite which fuses Wi-Fi with other signals on mobile platforms – is the first of its kind deployed in Hong Kong. It could reduce the position error to less than 2.5 meters in general environment, three times more accurate than traditional approaches. To locate a person, the technology combines signals from multiple sources such as Wi-Fi, geomagnetic field, Bluetooth, video and accelerometer reading. It has been deployed in Harbour City at Tsim Sha Tsui, and is now under commercial trials in malls (in collaboration with New World Development Research and Development, PCCW Solutions, and Link) and hospitals. "Existing location-based technologies often draw signals from a single source. As different signals have different limitations, their accuracy is not so satisfactory and their application environment is not general enough," said Prof Chan, also Director of Entrepreneurship Center at HKUST. "Our technology is to fuse the signals to combine their strengths while overcoming their limitations. The higher location accuracy makes possible novel location-based services and facilitates Hong Kong's development as a smart city." The technology can also create synergy with the government's smart lamp posts pilot scheme announced earlier as an initiative of the Smart City Blueprint, which plans to install multifunctional smart lamp posts starting 2019 to facilitate collection of real-time city data in enhancing city management and other public services. Incorporated with the technology, the lamp posts will not only provide timely location-based services to tourists and general public, but will also create immense social value on helping to find missing people, pets and preventing them from getting lost. Funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission's Innovation and Technology Fund and managed by Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies (LSCM R&D Center), Prof Chan's technology is now being commercialized through two start-ups run by HKUST graduates. The fusion technology is based on fingerprinting. Survey is first conducted to collect the signals at different locations of a given site. Using machine learning, the signal's characteristics at these locations are analyzed and modeled. Upon detecting signals from a user, the location of the user can then be estimated accurately and efficiently. Patents of the technology have been filed in the US and mainland China.
